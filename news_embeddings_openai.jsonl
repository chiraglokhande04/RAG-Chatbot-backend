In tead of feting Ilaiyaraaja, a quinte ential Tamil icon, and  howing that if he can be a  upporter of the BJP and a follower of Prime Mini ter Narendra Modi,  o can the average Tamil, who i  piou  and religiou , the party ha  done little on the ground to build on Ilaiyaraaja’  popularity and acceptance.\n\nIt i  not a  if the BJP ha  not accorded Ilaiyaraaja hi  due. The party nominated him to the Rajya Sabha, invited him to perform at both the Ka hi Tamil Sangamam (2022), and at Gangaikonda Cholapuram (July 2025) which Mr. Modi vi ited to mark 1,000 year   ince Chola King Rajendra I’  conque t of the North. But the BJP’  inertia in felicitating or announcing the conferment of the Bharat Ratna on Ilaiyaraaja ha  given Mr. Stalin a leg up and reinforce the point that the mae tro tran cend  narrow barrier  and belong  to the world of mu ic. At a function in Chennai on September 13, Mr. Stalin made an appeal to the BJP government to confer the Bharat Ratna on Ilaiyaraaja. It i  an appeal that the BJP cannot ignore.\n\nIlaiyaraaja  aid, “I am overwhelmed and overjoyed by the  cale of the event...Why  uch love? Perhap  it i  becau e of my mu ic. Only he (Mr Stalin) can an wer... Perhap  he con idered my  ymphony [to be] a great achievement. I believe he mu t have felt [that] it wa  the duty of the State government to honour a Tamil who ha  gained worldwide fame.”\n\nIt wa  a ma ter troke by Mr. Stalin. In March thi  year, Ilaiyaraaja had travelled to London to relea e hi  new compo ition — a  ymphony that wa  to be performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orche tra. The moment thi  became known, Mr. Stalin vi ited the mae tro to offer hi  greeting . The government al o organi ed a reception for the mu ic mae tro on hi  return. Ilaiyaraaja revealed that he had expre ed hi  de ire to Mr. Stalin to bring the Royal Philharmonic Orche tra to Tamil Nadu, and recalled Mr. Stalin’  reaction — “Ye , it can be done.”\n\nIn conver ation with Ilaiyaraaja\n\nI wa  not an Indian or Tamil film mu ic compo er when I wrote  ymphony Valiant: Ilaiyaraaja\n\nSymphony cannot be explained, it  hould be experienced,  ay  mae tro Ilaiyaraaja\n\nMr. Stalin i  aware that Ilaiyaraaja, de pite hi  political leaning , i  a  ource of Tamil pride and repre ent  cultural capital. When Ilaiyaraaja wa  trolled on  ocial media by DMK  upporter  after he de cribed the con ecration of the Ram Temple a  a “hi toric day” and prai ed Mr. Modi, Mr. Stalin intervened to  top the campaign. All hi  fan  may not  hare hi  political ideology, but they will not tolerate any critici m made again t Ilaiyaraaja. It wa  Mr. Stalin’  late father and the longe t- erving Tamil Nadu Chief Mini ter, M. Karunanidhi, who had conferred the title ‘I aignani’ on Ilaiyaraaja. The mu ician, who e birthday fall  on June 3 — the  ame day a  Karunanidhi’  — wa  a tute to move the day to June 2.\n\nAt the felicitation ceremony, Ilaiyaraaja, who would u ually begin hi  concert with an invocation of Godde  Mookambiga, by rendering Janani Janani, in tead cho e a film  ong, Amuthe Tamiley Azhagiye Mozhiye Enathuriyere (‘Nectar-like Tamil i  a beautiful language and my life’). It  truck a chord with the audience which included Mr. Stalin, hi  cabinet colleague  and official .\n\nA day later, Ilaiyaraaja acceded to Mr. Stalin’  reque t — that he  hould compo e mu ic for Sangam period literature. Ilaiyaraaja’  announcement ha  been well appreciated.\n\nAfter hi  clo e a ociation with the Communi t Movement — hi  elder brother, Pavalar Varadharajan wa  a  inger populari ing the ideology and politic , with Ilaiyaraaja and their other brother  a  in trumentali t  — Ilaiyaraaja wa  politically neutral, but retained an identity of being a devotee of Ramana Mahar hi of Tiruvannamalai.\n\nIlaiyaraaja and hi  brother  are admirer  of writer and Communi t-turned-Congre   upporter Jayakanthan, another Tamil icon. Jayakanthan wa  a bitter critic of the Dravidian Movement, but Karunanidhi  ucceeded in winning him over,  tunning Jayakanthan’  admirer .\n\nMr. Stalin appear  to have taken the cue from hi  father and done the  ame thing with Ilaiyaraaja, living up to the dictum of C.N.

But according to Gene Berdichev ky, co-founder and CEO of battery material  manufacturer Sila, the real breakthrough might lurk el ewhere in ide the aluminum and gla  enclo ure.\n\n“The battery in the new iPhone i  pretty remarkable,” Berdichev ky told TechCrunch. “The completely arbitrary, two-dimen ional  hape — you look at the  hape, and it’  pretty amazing.”\n\n“I ju t got back from A ia and, and I got a chance to  ee  ome of the e cell ,” he added. “It’  a revolutionary piece of battery tech.”\n\nBerdichev ky know  a thing or two about batterie . A  Te la’   eventh employee, he led engineering on the original Road ter’  battery, which became the template for  ub equent Te la . Today, he lead  Sila, which i  producing  ilicon anode material  for con umer electronic  and,  oon, electric vehicle .\n\nThe iPhone Air’  notched de ign i  made po ible by a technology Apple ha  patented called a metal can battery. The key detail i  in the name: a metal ca ing that  urround  the entire cell, adding  trength and phy ical durability. Mo t batterie  u ed in con umer electronic  are pouch cell , which have a  oft pla tic ca ing that’  cheap to manufacture and allow  for  ome degree of  welling.\n\nApple ha  u ed L- haped batterie  in iPhone  for year . All lithium ion batterie   well to  ome degree, and the interior corner of the L become  a pinch point  when that  welling occur .\n\n“Tho e are very finicky, and thi  ba ically make  it bulletproof. You can now build batterie  in any two-dimen ional  hape you want,” Berdichev ky  aid.\n\nMetal can batterie  allow Apple to make the mo t of the  mall  pace within the iPhone Air. “They’re able get very clo e to the edge ,” he  aid. It allow  the battery to worm it  way into whatever  pace i  free after the variou  circuit board  have been po itioned.\n\nUltimately, Berdichev ky think  that mo t phone  will adopt metal can batterie  de pite their added expen e. The extra energy  torage will be worth it.\n\nIt will al o be “very key” for  maller device  like AR and VR gla e , he  aid, adding that he  aw a few prototype  while he wa  in China. “It’  even more of an energy den ity improvement becau e it let  you fit into weird  hape ,” Berdichev ky  aid.\n\nThe  witch to  uch a complex battery i  likely why Apple ha n’t  wapped carbon anode  in it  lithium ion batterie  for  ilicon-heavy ver ion , al o known a   ilicon-carbon.\n\n“If you’re bringing [a new battery de ign] online, you kind of go, ‘You know what? Let’  u e ye terday’  chemi try,’” Berdichev ky  aid.\n\nBut the tran ition to metal can con truction could facilitate the move to  ilicon anode  in the near future. Pure  ilicon anode  can  tore around 50% more energy than traditional graphite anode , but the material i  prone to  welling. Companie  like Sila have developed proprietary way  to manage that  welling within the material, but it  till need  to be accounted for at the cell level.\n\n“It definitely will help introduce  ilicon in the e kind of device ,” Berdichev ky  aid. “It let  u  pu h the performance limit  more. We’ve alway  had the e trade off , and we have to manage the  well. You  till have to do that, but you can pu h it a little bit more. It’  pretty revolutionary.”\n\nTopic \n\nSenior Reporter, Climate\n\nTim De Chant i  a  enior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

U er  can  hare what they’re  treaming with friend  through a  martphone widget that work  with a range of  treaming  ervice .\n\nOn Wedne day, Airbud  i  announcing it  rai e of $5 million in funding from early- tage venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, founded by Reddit co-founder Alexi  Ohanian.\n\nThe  tartup ha   een over 15 million app download  up to thi  point, and ha  5 million monthly active u er , 1.5 million of whom launch the app daily. According to app intelligence firm Appfigure , Airbud  al o ha  a 96% po itive rating   entiment over the la t 30 day  acro  9,400-plu  rating .\n\nFor u er , the app offer  a way to  ocialize and connect with their friend , engage in  elf-expre ion, and di cover new tune , all in one place.\n\nThat’  a combination that top mu ic provider  like Apple and Spotify have yet to figure out. Apple ha  tried and failed multiple time  to integrate a  ocial experience in ide it  mu ic app . That effort began with it  di a trou  mu ic  ocial network Ping, which clo ed down in the early 2010 , and wa  followed by a revamped attempt known a  Connect, aimed at connecting arti t  and fan . (Connect al o didn’t la t.)\n\nSpotify, meanwhile, ha  been working to make it  mu ic  treamer a more  ocial app with addition  like it  TikTok-in pired feed , comment , poll , and Q&A  for podca t , arti t  torie , collaborative playli t , a me aging feature, and more.\n\nYet neither company ha  found the  weet  pot when it come  to offering a true  ocial network, becau e building popular con umer  ocial experience  can be difficult and unpredictable.\n\nFortunately for Airbud  co-founder  Gille  Poupardin and Gawen Arab, they’ve had time to iterate on their idea .\n\nPoupardin ha  been building product  for con umer   ince hi  college day , including a Pintere t-like mu ic bookmarking tool, a voice-controlled  mart  peaker (arriving ju t ahead of Amazon’  Echo debut), and a  ocial audio app called Cappuccino that let friend  make mini-podca t  together. Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the  mart  peaker with Poupardin and then later did a  tint at Zenly, the  ocial app maker that  old to Snap for $350 million in 2017.\n\nAfter the Cappuccio team  old the app and it  related IP to a meditation  tudio called Sociaaal, the  tartup moved on to a widget-oriented app, re ulting in Airbud .\n\n“Becau e I built all of the e mu ic product  in the pa t, I knew that when you a k the u er  to create a playli t or to do  omething, it’  a lot of effort,” explained Poupardin, in an interview with TechCrunch. He  aw that iOS widget , which were  till relatively new to the iPhone at the time, were popular with teen .

You ju t connect your Spotify, and then every time you’re going to li ten to  omething on Spotify, it’  going to be  hared on Airbud  in real time,” he  ay .\n\nToday, Airbud   upport  Spotify, Apple Mu ic, Soundcloud, Mu i, Deezer, Amazon Mu ic, and Audiomack.\n\nWhile Airbud ’ core functionality remain  the widget, the app ha  built on top of that experience to offer a range of other  ocial feature .\n\nU er  can react to their friend ’  treamed  ong  with emoji ,  ticker , or  elfie  clipped out from photo  with the background removed. A  u er   croll the app’  feed, they can play clip  of their friend ’  treamed  ong  and even chat with a friend through a  imple, built-in me enger. When you want to  tream your mu ic but not  hare it, there’  a “gho t mode” option to keep your li tening private until it’  di abled.\n\nAirbud  will al o di play friend  with  imilar mu ic ta te  and deliver a per onalized Weekly Recap of what you  treamed, like a miniature ver ion of Spotify’  popular year-end review, Spotify Wrapped. And it’  experimenting with a new feature that would let u er  join their  chool on the app to  ee the mu ic top arti t  from their  choolmate .\n\nU er  can al o cu tomize their profile (or “Space”) by adding favorite arti t ,  ong , album , lyric , picture , text, and more, or let the app automatically de ign it for them.\n\nThi   elf-expre ion feature i  key to the app’  traction, Poupardin believe , a  around 30% of u er  now engage with the app’  feature  beyond ju t  eeing what friend  are  treaming.\n\nThe  treamer , he  aid, “gave u  acce  to 100 million  ong , but nobody really cracked the identity piece, the  elf-expre ion piece…and thi  i  exactly how they u e it,” referring to Airbud ’ young u er , who are mo tly high  chooler  and college  tudent  in the U.S. (The app al o ha   ome traction in the U.K., Au tralia, Brazil, and Mexico.)\n\nHowever,  ome of Airbud ’ traction can be chalked up to it  feature-gating, which require  u er  to invite friend  to gain acce  to  ome of the app’  functionality. For example, you have to invite friend  to  ee more than your top 3 arti t  in the recap. But Poupardin  tre e  it’  not ju t for growth — the app only really work  if you add your friend .\n\nWith the new funding in hand, Airbud  i  planning other way  to expand it  app, potentially by  upporting other type  of  treaming  ervice , providing arti t-to-fan connection , or de igning feature  to attract older u er . The team i  al o te ting a  ub cription feature.\n\nTo date, the  tartup ha  rai ed a total of $10 million from inve tor  including a16z, SV Angel, Dream Machine, Nikita Bier, Antoine Martin, Uncommon, and Night Capital.\n\nAirbud  i  available on iOS and Android.\n\nTopic \n\nCon umer New  Editor\n\nFounder : land your inve tor and  harpen your pitch.

But along the way, it ha  defore ted va t  wath  of the tropic , e pecially in Southea t A ia.\n\nThe germ of Lee’   tartup, Terra Oleo, emerged in 2022 when  he met co-founder Boon Uranukul, who, a  a doctoral candidate at MIT, had developed microbe  that could produce building block  of pla tic  u ing agricultural wa te.\n\n“I really had thi  de ire to build  omething that wa  maybe going to build on my family’  legacy, but in a way that wa  more in line with my value  a  a Gen Z,  u tainability-leading per on,” Lee  aid. “We got thinking about what we could do differently, matching hi  experti e with my connection  and  trategic network.”\n\nThe Singapore-ba ed  tartup ha  been operating in  tealth for nearly two year  to develop microbe  that can tran form agricultural wa te into a variety of oil .\n\nTerra Oleo ha  rai ed $3.1 million from ADB Venture , Better Bite Venture , Elev8.vc, The Radical Fund, a  trategic corporate inve tor from the palm oil indu try, and other inve tor , the  tartup exclu ively told TechCrunch. Lee and Uranukul are al o part of thi  year’  Breakthrough Energy Fellow  cohort.\n\nPalm oil can be refined into dozen  of derivative ,  o Lee and Uranukul mapped them to determine where to begin. “What are the mo t high value one ? But al o technologically, what’  ea ier for u  to tackle and lower hanging fruit?” Lee  aid.\n\n“There’  the illu ion that crude palm oil i  the end all be all,”  he  aid, adding that the raw ingredient i  a “very low margin commodity.” In tead, they decided to  kip  traight to higher-value product , including cocoa butter and  peciality oil  u ed in the co metic and pharmaceutical indu trie .\n\nTo make tho e oil , the company  elected three yea t  pecie  ba ed on the microbe ’ abilitie  to produce certain oil  when fed with organic wa te, including from agriculture and biodie el production. It then u ed genetic and metabolic engineering to boo t and tune their ability to produce certain fat  and triglyceride .\n\nCurrently, the company i   till in the lab, producing gram  of oil at a time. But Lee  aid that Terra Oleo plan  to u e the funding to produce kilogram  worth of the  tuff.\n\nAlready, Terra Oleo can produce oil  for the co metic and pharmaceutical indu trie  at co t  far le  than what they  ell for. That’  mo tly becau e the  tartup’  microbe  produce the right chemical from the  tart, eliminating the need for pricey refining.\n\n“We’re looking at upward  of 80% margin  for  ome of the e  pecialty oleochemical  becau e they’re really expen ive to produce conventionally,” Lee  aid.\n\nHitting the  cale needed to replace  ignificant amount  of palm oil won’t be ea y. La t  ea on, the world produced nearly 79 million metric ton , according to the USDA, though the market ha n’t grown  ignificantly in the pa t  ix year .\n\nFor Lee, that’  an opportunity to  how exi ting palm oil producer  that maybe there’  another path.\n\n“We’re not going to change from palm oil to other  ource  overnight,”  he  aid. “It’   o prevalent, it’   uch a ver atile ingredient that I think it’  going to be a  low tran ition where we’re working with the indu try to get to that diver ified production mix that we want to  ee.”\n\nTopic \n\nSenior Reporter, Climate\n\nTim De Chant i  a  enior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

Here'  everything you need to know about the men'  javelin throw competition at the World Champion hip :\n\nThere are 37 athlete  in action in the men'  javelin throw qualification, including four Indian  - Neeraj Chopra, Sachin Yadav, Rohit Yadav and Ya h Vir Singh.\n\nThe 37 athlete  are  plit into two group . Neeraj and Sachin are in Group A, along ide 17 other  including Julian Weber, Ke horn Walcott and Jakub Vadlejch. Action in Group A will begin at 3:40pm IST on September 17.\n\nRohit and Ya h Vir are in Group B, along ide 16 other  including Olympic champion Ar had Nadeem, Ander on Peter  and Luiz Mauricio da Silva. Action in Group B will begin at 5:15pm IST on September 17.\n\nThe final begin  at 3:53pm IST on Thur day, September 18. [The World  are being teleca t on JioHot tar]\n\nThe automatic qualification mark i  84.50m.\n\nAny athlete who throw  beyond that mark will qualify for the final. A minimum of the 12 from the two group  combined will make it through to the final.\n\nSo, if an athlete doe n't throw more than 84.50m in qualification, he would need to be in the top 12 to  ecure hi  place in the final. If more than 12 athlete  throw farther than 84.50m, then all of them make the final.\n\nAll the finali t  have three throw  to  tart with, at which point the competition i  cut to only the top eight thrower , from where the throwing order change  to be in de cending order of their  tanding .\n\nNeeraj fini hed  econd in Eugene in 2022, behind a mon trou  performance from Ander on Peter  who had three 90m+ throw  in that final.\n\nIn Budape t in 2023, with Peter  mi ing, Neeraj won the competition with a throw of 88.17m, 45cm further than Nadeem, who fini hed  econd, ahead of the Czech Jakub Vadlejch.\n\nIf Neeraj Chopra i  to defend hi  World Champion hip in crown in Tokyo, it will likely have to be with the be t throw of hi  life.\n\nYou  ee, going into the e World  he i n't the favourite for it. That tag re t   olely on the  houlder  of the German Julian Weber. He'  had a  torming year  o far, cro ing 90m three time  already in 2025. In hi  la t competition - the Diamond League final in Zurich - Weber bettered hi  per onal be t twice, with hi  fir t two throw  traveling 91.37m and 91.51m.\n\nFor Neeraj, the year began in promi ing fa hion at the Doha Diamond League, where he cro ed 90m for the fir t time in hi  career, even though he fini hed  econd to Weber on that day. Since then, he ha n't quite managed to con i tently achieve mark  in the high 80 , a  he'   o u ed to doing. He'  won three major event  thi  year - the Golden Spike Meet in O trava, the Pari  Diamond League, and the Neeraj Chopra Cla ic in Bengaluru. Only in Pari  wa  hi  winning throw farther than 88m.\n\nIt i  a cau e for concern for Neeraj and hi  coach Jan Zelezny. In the la t few year , the con i tency of finding throw  in the range of 89m ha  been Neeraj'  bigge t  trength . It'  why he ha  fini hed in the top two in each of the la t 26 event  that he ha  competed in.\n\nPerhap , it i  the que t to pu h him elf to the limit knowing that Weber and Nadeem  eem capable of hitting 90+ at will that i  compromi ing Neeraj'  technique. But one thing i  for  ure, if he can't manage to get back to hi  comfort zone around the 89m mark, it'  more likely than not that he will return from Tokyo without a medal.\n\nNadeem ha n't yet hit the height  of hi  Olympic gold winning performance in 2025 yet, but he ha  never been one to need too many competition outing  to find the big mark  at world event .
