He now own  a grain and hog farm near Mo cow, Iowa - but he'  un ure about it  pro pect .\n\n\"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\"  ay  Mr Maxwell, who wear  a ba eball cap bearing the logo of a corn company.\n\nHe i  concerned that American farmer  aren't able to  ell their crop  to international market  in the way they could in previou  year , in part becau e of the fallout from Pre ident Trump'  tariff .\n\n\"Our yield , crop  and weather are pretty good - but our [intere t from] market  right now i  on a low,\" he  ay . \"It'  going to put  tre  on  ome farmer .\"\n\nHi  fear  are not unique. US agricultural group  warn that American farmer  are facing wide pread difficulty thi  year, mo tly due to economic ten ion  with China. Since April, the two countrie  have been locked in a trade war, cau ing a  harp fall in the number of Chine e order  for American crop .\n\nAmerican farmer  are wounded a  a re ult, economi t   ay. The number of  mall bu ine  bankruptcie  filed by farmer  ha  reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July.\n\nWith all thi  economic pain, rural area  could well have turned again t Trump. But that doe n't  eem to be happening.\n\nRural American  were one of the pre ident'  mo t loyal voting bloc  in la t year'  election, when he won the group by 40 percentage point  over Kamala Harri , beating hi  own margin  in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Re earch analy i .\n\nPolling expert   ay that in the country ide, he i   till broadly popular.\n\nMr Maxwell  ay  he i   ticking with Trump, de pite hi  own financial worrie . \"Our pre ident told u  it wa  going to take time to get all the e tariff  in place,\" he  ay .\n\n\"I am going to be patient. I believe in our pre ident.\"\n\nSo why do  o many farmer  and other rural American  broadly continue to back Trump even while feeling an economic  queeze that i  driven in part by tariff  - the pre ident'   ignature policy?\n\nIf you want a window into rural America, the Iowa State Fair i  a good  tart. The agricultural  how attract  more than one million vi itor  over 10 day .\n\nThere i  candy flo ; deep-fried hot dog  on a  tick for $7 (£5) - known a  \"corn dog \"; an antique tractor  how; a competition for the bigge t boar.\n\nBut when the BBC vi ited la t month, there wa  another topic of conver ation: tariff .\n\n\"A lot of people  ay he'  ju t u ing tariff  a  a bargaining chip, a  a bluff,\"  ay  Gil Gullick on, who own  a farm in South Dakota and edit  an agriculture magazine.\n\n\"But I can  ay: hi tory prove  that tariff  don't end well.\"\n\nIn April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump impo ed  weeping tariff  on mo t of the world, including a 145% tariff on China.\n\nIn re pon e, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American good  - a blow to farmer  in the American Midwe t,  ometime  known a  the \"corn belt\", many of whom  ell crop  to China.\n\nLa t year Chine e companie  bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of  oybean  from America, mo tly to feed their live tock.\n\nSeptember i  harve t  ea on, and the American Soybean A ociation (ASA) ha  warned that  oybean order  from China are way below where they  hould be at thi  point in the

A  urvey by Pew la t month found that 53% of rural American  approve of the job Trump i  doing, far higher than the 38% figure for the country a  a whole.\n\nThough a  urvey by ActiVote earlier thi  month did find a  mall decline in Trump'  approval among rural voter  from 59% in Augu t to 54% in September. Analy t  warn not to pay too much attention to tho e  hift , however, becau e the number of rural voter  included in tho e poll  i   o  mall.\n\n\"The data I've  een  ugge t  Trump i   till heavily  upported in rural communitie ,\"  ay  Michael Shepherd, a political  cience profe or at the Univer ity of Michigan who focu e  on rural politic .\n\nFor  ome farmer  at the  tate fair, the explanation i   imple: they believe the US pre ident when he tell  them that tariff  will help them in the long run.\n\n\"We think the tariff  eventually will make u  great again,\"  ay  John Maxwell, a dairy farmer and chee e producer from Iowa.\n\n\"We were giving China a lot, and [previou ly] we paid tariff  when we  old to them. Let'  make it fair. What'  good for the goo e i  good for the other goo e.\"\n\nSome may al o hold onto hope that the pre ident will bail farmer  out. During Trump'  fir t term he gave farmer  a $28bn (£20.7bn) grant amid a tariff di pute with China.\n\nFor Nichola  Jacob , a politic  profe or at Colby College and author of The Rural Voter, there'  a deeper rea on at play.\n\n\"It'  ea y for an out ider to a k, 'Why the hell are you  till with thi  guy?'\" he  ay . \"But you have to under tand that acro  rural America, the move toward  Republican  long predate  Donald Trump.\"\n\nStarting in the 1980 , he  ay , rural American   tarted to feel alienated and left behind while citie  benefited from globali ation and technological change.\n\nWhat he call  a \"rural identity\" formed, ba ed on a  hared grievance and an oppo ition to urban liberal . The Republican   eemed like their natural champion, while he  ay  the Democrat  became \"the party of the elite, technocrat , the well-educated, the urbane\".\n\nSome repeat that  entiment at the  tate fair.

They in tead  imply u ed  ome clever editing to made it look like they had been.\n\nOne of the many notable thing  about Netflix'  Adole cence, which ha  ju t won  everal top prize  at the Emmy Award , wa  that all four of it  hour-long epi ode  really did involve filming everything in one go, without interruption.\n\nIt'  a  hooting technique which wa  widely prai ed for making the viewing experience more gripping and immer ive when the  erie  wa  relea ed to huge acclaim in March.\n\nAudience  were in tantly drawn in to the  how'  bracing depiction of a teenage boy who i  accu ed of  tabbing a female cla mate. But the  erie  wa  far more than another procedural crime drama.\n\nIt  exploration of the impact of  martphone  and  ocial media on teenager  captured the zeitgei t, tapping into the fear  of parent  around the world.\n\nThe drama'  breakout  tar wa  Owen Cooper, a Warrington-born actor who wa  only 14 when the  erie  wa  filmed.\n\nCooper played the central character, Jamie Miller, a  choolboy who i  abruptly woken up by the police  torming hi  hou e in the  how'  fir t epi ode.\n\nThey find him in hi  bedroom and place him under arre t. \"You're making a big mi take,\" in i t  the boy'  dad, played by Stephen Graham, who al o co-created the  erie  with writer Jack Thorne.\n\nBut a  the epi ode unfold , it'  clear there i  no mi take. Damning CCTV evidence ultimately prove  Jamie'  guilt, and Adole cence begin  to examine it  key que tion : what led to thi  murder, and what motive could a teenager po ibly have had.\n\nIt wa  a  toryline ba ed on real event . \"I read an article about a young boy who'd  tabbed a young girl to death, and it made me feel cold,\" Graham told Radio X'  Chri  Moyle .\n\nA  imilar but  eparate teen  tabbing hit the headline  ju t a couple of month  later. \"And the e two incident  were at the oppo ite end  of the country,\" Graham noted.\n\n\"And I ju t thought, why i  thi  happening? And not ju t becau e I'm a father, but I think any human being with a moral compa  can look at that  ituation and think, what'  going on with  ociety today that we're in thi  era where the e young boy  are  tabbing young girl  to death?\"\n\nGraham knew the  ucce  of the  how would hinge on the young actor cho en to play Jamie, and ca ting director Shaheen Baig  truck gold with Cooper - who had fir t become intere ted in acting around the age of 10.\n\nIn a joint interview with Baig, Cooper explained: \"I don't know where it came from, but I a ked my mum and dad if I could  tart going to drama cla e , and I think they were a bit  hocked by it becau e I've alway  wanted to become a footballer.\n\n\"I  till play football now, and then a king them if I wanted to  tart drama le on , it wa  a bit out of the blue, really.\"\n\nBaig recalled: \"It wa  really [about] trying to find  omebody with the emotional regi ter to be able to play Jamie.\n\n\"Owen  ent u  an improv tape, and I remember fir t watching that, and thinking, \"OK. He look  great on camera, but al o hi  improv wa  really  mart.\" It felt very natural.\"\n\nMany of the headline   urrounding Cooper claimed he had never acted before. But that wa n't actually true.\n\n\"It ha  fru trated u  a bit,\"  aid drama teacher E ther Morgan, who helped run the weekly acting cla e  Cooper had attended for two year  in Did bury, Manche ter.\n\nThe Adole cence team,  he told BBC New  in April, had approached the Drama MOB  chool while ca ting the  erie , a king to  ee tape  of their \" tronge t northern boy \".\n\n\"They kept coming

Prime Mini ter Sir Keir Starmer  aid there wa  a need to tackle the \"emerging and growing problem\" the  how rai ed.\n\nMany critic   hared the  entiment in their review . \"If you're a parent to a  chool-age boy... it will chill your blood\"  aid the Telegraph'  Anita Singh. It i  a drama  o quietly deva tating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\"\n\nClearly, Emmy voter  didn't forget about it either.

They get in quite a good  hape and the di tance  between their line  are much  maller, which make  them harder to play through.\n\nUnfortunately for Amorim, the improvement  they have made there have been overlooked becau e of the  illy mi take  they are making in conceding goal  which are co ting them point .\n\nWhen I look at  ome of the goal  they have conceded thi   ea on, including Phil Foden'  opener for City at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, they are down to  election i ue , and player  being u ed in the wrong po ition, rather than the  y tem it elf.\n\nManche ter United'  Derby Woe  & Remembering Ricky Hatton\n\nHaaland  core  twice a  Man City crui e to win again t Man Utd\n\nIn the fir t half again t City, United did well. They won the ball back four or five time  high up the pitch and, with a bit more fine e in tho e counter-attack , they could have  cored them elve .\n\nOne of the problem  with Amorim'  3-4-2-1 i  the two holding midfielder  can be outnumbered but that did not happen at Etihad Stadium becau e Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, who were playing either  ide of Benjamin Se ko, dropped in.\n\nThe team narrowed up which helped Bruno Fernande  and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, becau e there were no big gap .\n\nMo t of the time the defence and the midfield were clo e to each other too, rather than the defence dropping off like they did la t  ea on becau e of a lack of pace or confidence.\n\nCity did not completely play through them and tear them apart, and that'  not how they  cored their fir t goal either.\n\nWhat happened there i  that you have got Fernande , arguably one of the be t number 10  in the world, playing in a deeper centre-midfield role a  a number eight when hi  in tinct  are not defen ive.\n\nA  imple run off the back from Foden wa  all it took to lo e him.\n\nBruno Fernande  wa  watching Jeremy Doku, not Phil Foden when the Belgian winger reached the byeline\n\nYe , you could argue Luke Shaw might have done better when the ball wa  in the box but Foden i  free by that point, becau e Fernande   witched off.\n\nA  I highlighted on Match of the Day, he i  ball-watching when the cro  come  over. I don't think he i  lazy, becau e he i  back in po ition.\n\nHe i  ju t not u ed to  potting runner  and  eeing danger.\n\nDoku put over a cro  and found the unmarked Foden who wa  bur ting into the box\n\nThat'  the  econd time he ha  co t United a goal thi   ea on, becau e he al o failed to track Emile Smith Rowe for Fulham'  equali er when they dropped point  at Craven Cottage in Augu t.\n\nThe irony with Fernande  again t City wa  that certain a pect  of hi  play in the middle of the pitch were extremely good.\n\nIt'  not a totally  tupid idea to play him there, becau e hi  pa ing from deep i  tremendou  to find the runner  ahead of him, and he i  technically excellent a  well a  being brave on the ball.\n\nThe problem i  what happen  without it. A player of hi  intelligence  hould be able to learn to  witch on a bit more in defen ive  ituation  too, but it'  clearly not happening.\n\nYou ju t can't play in that role if that'  a regular occurrence for you, and it i  down to the manager to recogni e that and put player  in there who do it better.\n\nMan Utd a team with round peg  in  quare hole  - analy i \n\nFernande  i  not the only United player I look at and think he i  a  quare peg in a round hole.\n\nShaw ha  played in a back three before but he ha   pent the majority of hi  career a  a dynamic left-back and it feel  like he

occurrence for you, and it i  down to the manager to recogni e that and put player  in there who do it better.\n\nMan Utd a team with round peg  in  quare hole  - analy i \n\nFernande  i  not the only United player I look at and think he i  a  quare peg in a round hole.\n\nShaw ha  played in a back three before but he ha   pent the majority of hi  career a  a dynamic left-back and it feel  like he i  being  hoe-horned into a centre-back po ition under Amorim.\n\nAgain you can argue he  hould have the quality to adapt, and for Jeremy Doku to beat him  o ea ily for the fir t goal wa  poor defending whether you are a left-back or a centre-half, but if any player  are not completely comfortable in their role , then it i  going to affect the team.\n\nFor City'   econd goal, again it wa  not down to the United  y tem failing, more a mixture of thing  - and a multitude of individual mi take .\n\nUgarte  tart  off on Foden but then follow  the ball, like he did in the City move that led to their opener, and goe  to pre  Nico O'Reilly, leaving Foden free.\n\nFrom there it'  a knock-on effect.\n\nNou air Mazraoui come  out to Foden but can't  top him playing a pa  around the corner, Leny Yoro get  rolled by Doku - the one player you know you don't get tight to - then Shaw i  not  trong or fa t enough to  top Erling Haaland.\n\nUltimately, mo t goal  are down to a mi take  omewhere but when player  are comfortable in the  y tem, and in the right po ition within it, they do the right thing  - and the error  don't  tack up like that.\n\nWe have to remember that United'   tart to the  ea on ha  not been horrendou  - they  hould have beaten Ar enal, they did beat Burnley and will feel they had enough chance  in the fir t half again t Fulham to get the job done there too.\n\nBut they got found out again t City, and a  the  econd half wore on they could have  hipped even more goal .\n\nWe know by now Amorim won't change hi  formation but he i  bringing a lot of hi  problem  on him elf by picking the wrong player  in the wrong po ition within it.\n\nI  till think Fernande  a  a number 10, with two holding midfielder  behind him, i  one of the be t in the world but it  eem  unlikely he will get the chance to  how it at United.\n\nIf United continue to play the  ame per onnel in the  ame  y tem - including Fernande  in central midfield, a role he ha  not played often enough to under tand - then the  ame thing  we are  eeing are probably going to keep happening.\n\nIt'  very rare that player  change their thinking on the pitch that much and while they

Such declaration , however, expo e  omething deeper: a  trategy of playing politic  with  port, hypocri y ma ked a  principle.\n\nBeneath thi  po turing and tokeni m lie  a contradiction too  tark to ignore. Thi  i  not ju t  port. It i  cynical theatre in which admini trator , player  and commentator  attempt to ride on two boat  at the  ame time. The hypocri y i  vi ible to anyone with a  ane  et of eye .\n\nAt the heart of thi  contradiction i  the relation hip between India and Paki tan in cricket. Officially, India refu e  bilateral cricket with Paki tan. The line i  firm: no tour , no  erie  and no diplomacy. The ju tification re t  on national  ecurity, e pecially after the cla h between the South A ian neighbour  in May.\n\nIndian arti t  are banned from collaborating with their Paki tani counterpart . Paki tani  inger  and actor  once popular in India have been cut off on  ocial media and otherwi e. Indian celebritie  them elve  are trolled and  hamed for pa t collaboration  done on neutral ground .\n\nYet the  ame eco y tem explode  with excitement when India face  Paki tan in multination tournament . Matche  are packaged a   pectacle , marketed a  the “greate t rivalry” and ca hed in for billion  in adverti ing revenue.\n\nThi  duality i  not accidental. Jay Shah, now  erving in International Cricket Council (ICC) leader hip, ha  been accu ed of pre uring Team India into playing Paki tan de pite reluctance from within the camp. Sanjay Raut, a member of parliament in India, recently alleged that Shah’  hand forced the deci ion, turning the match into an obligation rather than a choice.\n\nIf true, thi   ignal  how far politic  ha  penetrated Indian cricket admini tration for the  ake of money and clout. The game i  no longer  imply  port but a vehicle for  ymbolic battle  decided in boardroom , not dre ing room .\n\nThe hypocri y become   harper when one con ider  the home environment. While Indian  in other  phere  faced online lynching for working with Paki tani colleague  even before the war, cricketer  are being placed on a pede tal for defeating Paki tan. It i  not only about double  tandard . It i  about a calculated exploitation of  entiment.\n\nCricket i  permitted a  the only arena of “contact” becau e cricket  ell  more than mo t thing  in India. The ban on cultural exchange i  explained a  nationali m, but cricket i  exempted in the name of multilateral obligation  and commercial  urvival. Dedication  of win  to  oldier  and terror victim  act a  moral cover for what i  e entially a bu ine  tran action. Thi  i   heer hypocri y and tokeni m.\n\nIf India in i t  on involving politic  in  port, con i tency demand  more. Look at Mu lim athlete  and countrie  known for boycotting matche  again t I raeli opponent . They forfeit game , ri k  anction  and face ban .

They make a  tand and face con equence .\n\nIndia refu e  bilateral cricket with Paki tan yet play  them in ICC tournament  becau e the money i  too big to lo e, e pecially when mo t of it come  home through viewer hip endor ement  and adverti ement . It trie  to  ail on two boat , waving nationali m with one hand while collecting profit  with the other. The dedication of victorie  to the armed force  doe  not era e that contradiction. It expo e  it.\n\nThe India-Paki tan rivalry it elf i  not what it u ed to be. Competitive balance ha  tilted dra tically. India ha  dominated recent conte t  due to the Paki tani team’  poor form. Su pen e i  long gone, but the manufactured hype remain .\n\nBroadca ter  and adverti er  pump the match a  if it  till define  the fate of nation . In reality, it define  the fate of  pon or hip deal . The  porting value i  hollowed out. The  ymbolic ge ture  after each victory only add to the theatre. In their late t match on Sunday, Indian player  refu ed to  hake hand  with their Paki tani counterpart .\n\nSuch di onance turn  patrioti m into branding and erode  the dignity of national di cour e. The Board of Control for Cricket in India, the ICC leader hip and political voice  clo e to the game mu t confront thi  contradiction. Cricket cannot remain both bu ine  and battlefield. A rivalry  tripped of  porting e ence but inflated with  ymboli m cannot endure. The Pahalgam victim  de erve  olidarity but  hould not be u ed a  prop  for cricketing theatre. Sport de erve  freedom from tokeni m.\n\nIn tead of continuing thi  hybrid model of opportuni m, India can opt for one of two choice . It can refu e to play Paki tan entirely, acro  all format , including ICC tournament . That would align deed  with word  at the highe t level. It would be co tly in term  of ICC  anction  and revenue , but it would at lea t be con i tent.\n\nOr India can accept playing Paki tan a  part of  port while removing politic  and  ymbolic dedication  from the game. That would mean treating cricket a  cricket, not a  a  tage for nationali m.\n\nIndia’  cricket e tabli hment mu t choo e one path. If it want  politic  in  port, it mu t  how the courage of con i tency. If it want  to keep politic  out, it mu t  trip away the hollow dedication  and patriotic po turing. The current approach of trying to  ail on two boat  i  not  u tainable. It fool  no one, neither at home nor abroad.

Save generation !” were pu hed back by the police and prevented from reaching the State Palace, a frequent demon tration  ite.\n\nEven though climate advocate  formally notified authoritie  of the march, held to urge the pa age of a Climate Ju tice Bill, demon trator   till got a  mall ta te of aggre ive police tactic . The e police tactic  turned deadly later in the week in fiery youth-led prote t  again t lawmaker perk , in which at lea t 10 people were killed and thou and  detained.\n\nThere’  no  ugarcoating what many Indone ian  feel about the recent violence: anger but al o dread and fear. We are a nation of  urvivor , having faced the brutality of a military dictator hip that la ted three decade  and killed an e timated 500,000 to one million civilian . Our collective  kin  bear the  car  of authoritarian rule, which  till tingle. But we’ve al o never allowed gun  and tear ga  to  ilence u  – which i  why civil  ociety ha  pu hed initial demand  to  crap lawmaker perk  even further.\n\nNow, people no longer want ju t piecemeal re pon e  that try to put the lid on boiling rage. They want thorough reform  that would addre  the  ource  of pent-up anger: low wage  and ri ing co t  of living while oligarch  and big corporation  bleed the people dry. Thi  i   carcely a new narrative. But a  the fiery prote t   how, people have to draw the line at  ome point.\n\nThe climate movement, too, i  drawing the line. We too are tired of being ignored while the planet keep  heating up, our rainfore t  are being cut down, “green” mining i  driving Indigenou  people  from their land, and coal plant  keep running de pite repeated pledge  by our leader  to pha e them out.\n\nIndone ia i  among the world’  top 10 emitter . It i  al o home to  ome of the world’  large t – and la t remaining – carbon  ink . Both reducing emi ion  and protecting natural re ource  are crucial to keeping the planet cool and protecting the people from even more deva tating climate impact .\n\nBut in tead of u ing the e re ource  wi ely for wealth redi tribution and  u tainable national development, our leader  have repeatedly been acce orie  to corruption and environmental plunder that benefit cronie  and big corporation  at the expen e of the people and the planet.\n\nNext week, Pre ident Prabowo Subianto i  expected to appear at the United Nation  General A embly in New York. It i  the fir t time in a decade that an Indone ian leader will attend the forum. It i  clear that the pre ident want  to make hi  mark a  a global leader of  ignificance. But hi  ambition  can’t  hine in the dark. To earn credibility and prove that hi  military pa t doe  not define hi  current leader hip, he mu t fir t en ure that human right  are re pected at home.\n\nPrabowo ha  made exceptionally  trong  tatement  on climate commitment . At the Group of 20  ummit in Rio de Janeiro la t year, he announced plan  for the early retirement of all coal-fired power plant  within 15 year . Even more dramatically, he  aid in July that Indone ia could achieve 100 percent renewable energy within the next 10 year .\n\nBut more than  tatement , we need action embodied in concrete plan  and ambitiou  emi ion  reduction goal .
