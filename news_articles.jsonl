Stalin, has scored a point. By taking it upon himself and the State government to honour maestro Ilaiyaraaja, on a mass scale, on his completion of 50 years in the film industry and for composing a symphony, Mr. Stalin has focused on what the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to capitalise on. Instead of feting Ilaiyaraaja, a quintessential Tamil icon, and showing that if he can be a supporter of the BJP and a follower of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so can the average Tamil, who is pious and religious, the party has done little on the ground to build on Ilaiyaraaja’s popularity and acceptance.\n\nIt is not as if the BJP has not accorded Ilaiyaraaja his due. The party nominated him to the Rajya Sabha, invited him to perform at both the Kashi Tamil Sangamam (2022), and at Gangaikonda Cholapuram (July 2025) which Mr. Modi visited to mark 1,000 years since Chola King Rajendra I’s conquest of the North. But the BJP’s inertia in felicitating or announcing the conferment of the Bharat Ratna on Ilaiyaraaja has given Mr. Stalin a leg up and reinforce the point that the maestro transcends narrow barriers and belongs to the world of music. At a function in Chennai on September 13, Mr. Stalin made an appeal to the BJP government to confer the Bharat Ratna on Ilaiyaraaja. It is an appeal that the BJP cannot ignore.\n\nIlaiyaraaja said, “I am overwhelmed and overjoyed by the scale of the event...Why such love? Perhaps it is because of my music. Only he (Mr Stalin) can answer... Perhaps he considered my symphony [to be] a great achievement. I believe he must have felt [that] it was the duty of the State government to honour a Tamil who has gained worldwide fame.”\n\nIt was a masterstroke by Mr. Stalin. In March this year, Ilaiyaraaja had travelled to London to release his new composition — a symphony that was to be performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The moment this became known, Mr. Stalin visited the maestro to offer his greetings. The government also organised a reception for the music maestro on his return. Ilaiyaraaja revealed that he had expressed his desire to Mr. Stalin to bring the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to Tamil Nadu, and recalled Mr. Stalin’s reaction — “Yes, it can be done.”\n\nIn conversation with Ilaiyaraaja\n\nI was not an Indian or Tamil film music composer when I wrote symphony Valiant: Ilaiyaraaja\n\nSymphony cannot be explained, it should be experienced, says maestro Ilaiyaraaja\n\nMr. Stalin is aware that Ilaiyaraaja, despite his political leanings, is a source of Tamil pride and represents cultural capital. When Ilaiyaraaja was trolled on social media by DMK supporters after he described the consecration of the Ram Temple as a “historic day” and praised Mr. Modi, Mr. Stalin intervened to stop the campaign. All his fans may not share his political ideology, but they will not tolerate any criticism made against Ilaiyaraaja. It was Mr. Stalin’s late father and the longest-serving Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi, who had conferred the title ‘Isaignani’ on Ilaiyaraaja. The musician, whose birthday falls on June 3 — the same day as Karunanidhi’s — was astute to move the day to June 2.\n\nAt the felicitation ceremony, Ilaiyaraaja, who would usually begin his concert with an invocation of Goddess Mookambiga, by rendering Janani Janani, instead chose a film song, Amuthe Tamiley Azhagiye Mozhiye Enathuriyere (‘Nectar-like Tamil is a beautiful language and my life’). It struck a chord with the audience which included Mr. Stalin, his cabinet colleagues and officials.\n\nA day later, Ilaiyaraaja acceded to Mr. Stalin’s request — that he should compose music for Sangam period literature. Ilaiyaraaja’s announcement has been well appreciated.\n\nAfter his close association with the Communist Movement — his elder brother, Pavalar Varadharajan was a singer popularising the ideology and politics, with Ilaiyaraaja and their other brothers as instrumentalists — Ilaiyaraaja was politically neutral, but retained an identity of being a devotee of Ramana Maharshi of Tiruvannamalai.\n\nIlaiyaraaja and his brothers are admirers of writer and Communist-turned-Congress supporter Jayakanthan, another Tamil icon. Jayakanthan was a bitter critic of the Dravidian Movement, but Karunanidhi succeeded in winning him over, stunning Jayakanthan’s admirers.\n\nMr. Stalin appears to have taken the cue from his father and done the same thing with Ilaiyaraaja, living up to the dictum of C.N. Annadurai, the founder of DMK, that “jasmine smells sweet even if it blooms in another’s garden.”\n\nkolappan.b@thehindu.co.in"}

Besides, a compensation cess is levied on luxury items and demerit or sin goods.\n\nWith the reduction in rates on most goods, the onus is now on trade and industry to pass on the benefit of these tax rate changes to consumers and align compliance in a timely manner.\n\nAMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said by issuing clear schedules in the notification, the government had provided the much-needed clarity on applicable rates across a wide spectrum of goods.\n\n“With this clarity in place, the ball is now in the industry’s court. Businesses must promptly update their systems, revise pricing, and ensure smooth implementation of the new rates across supply chains,” Mr. Mohan said.\n\nThe success of this reform would depend on how effectively and transparently the industry adopted these revised tax rates, he added.\n\nEY Tax Partner Saurabh Agarwal said as rate notifications were now being released, it was imperative for industries to align their ERP systems, pricing decisions and supply chain.\n\n“This strategic alignment is critical to ensure a smooth implementation and, crucially, to guarantee that the benefits of this rate rationalisation are effectively passed on to the end consumer,” Mr. Agarwal said.\n\nThe decision to lower tax rates to benefit the common man was taken by the GST Council, comprising the Centre and States, at its meeting on September 3, 2025."}

But according to Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder and CEO of battery materials manufacturer Sila, the real breakthrough might lurk elsewhere inside the aluminum and glass enclosure.\n\n“The battery in the new iPhone is pretty remarkable,” Berdichevsky told TechCrunch. “The completely arbitrary, two-dimensional shape — you look at the shape, and it’s pretty amazing.”\n\n“I just got back from Asia and, and I got a chance to see some of these cells,” he added. “It’s a revolutionary piece of battery tech.”\n\nBerdichevsky knows a thing or two about batteries. As Tesla’s seventh employee, he led engineering on the original Roadster’s battery, which became the template for subsequent Teslas. Today, he leads Sila, which is producing silicon anode materials for consumer electronics and, soon, electric vehicles.\n\nThe iPhone Air’s notched design is made possible by a technology Apple has patented called a metal can battery. The key detail is in the name: a metal casing that surrounds the entire cell, adding strength and physical durability. Most batteries used in consumer electronics are pouch cells, which have a soft plastic casing that’s cheap to manufacture and allows for some degree of swelling.\n\nApple has used L-shaped batteries in iPhones for years. All lithium ion batteries swell to some degree, and the interior corner of the L becomes a pinch points when that swelling occurs.\n\n“Those are very finicky, and this basically makes it bulletproof. You can now build batteries in any two-dimensional shape you want,” Berdichevsky said.\n\nMetal can batteries allow Apple to make the most of the small space within the iPhone Air. “They’re able get very close to the edges,” he said. It allows the battery to worm its way into whatever space is free after the various circuit boards have been positioned.\n\nUltimately, Berdichevsky thinks that most phones will adopt metal can batteries despite their added expense. The extra energy storage will be worth it.\n\nIt will also be “very key” for smaller devices like AR and VR glasses, he said, adding that he saw a few prototypes while he was in China. “It’s even more of an energy density improvement because it lets you fit into weird shapes,” Berdichevsky said.\n\nThe switch to such a complex battery is likely why Apple hasn’t swapped carbon anodes in its lithium ion batteries for silicon-heavy versions, also known as silicon-carbon.\n\n“If you’re bringing [a new battery design] online, you kind of go, ‘You know what? Let’s use yesterday’s chemistry,’” Berdichevsky said.\n\nBut the transition to metal can construction could facilitate the move to silicon anodes in the near future. Pure silicon anodes can store around 50% more energy than traditional graphite anodes, but the material is prone to swelling. Companies like Sila have developed proprietary ways to manage that swelling within the material, but it still needs to be accounted for at the cell level.\n\n“It definitely will help introduce silicon in these kind of devices,” Berdichevsky said. “It lets us push the performance limits more. We’ve always had these trade offs, and we have to manage the swell. You still have to do that, but you can push it a little bit more. It’s pretty revolutionary.”\n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter, Climate\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

With these features, the company aims to compete with verticalized meeting startups and productivity suites.\n\nThe company has long offered an AI bot that can record and transcribe Zoom meetings. However, cross-application meeting notetakers like Read AI, Otter, Fireflies, Granola, and Circleback have made great progress. To tackle that, Zoom is making its AI companion work with other platforms such as Meet and Microsoft Teams, along with a feature to take notes during in-person meetings.\n\nThe company is taking a page out of Granola’s book to let users jot down their own notes during meetings, then have AI expand and structure them later. Zoom is also adding cross-platform search so users can retrieve information from across Google and Microsoft’s platforms.\n\nNew calendar-related features are also on the way. Through its AI Companion, the company will allow users to find time slots that work for all attendees. Plus, it can suggest meetings you can skip through a new “free up my time” request. (Notably, calendar tool Clokcwise launched a similar tool last year to resolve meeting conflicts.)\n\nThe company is also rolling out proactive meeting recommendations, such as suggested tasks and agenda items for meeting prep, and a group AI assistant for a group.\n\nZoom will introduce photorealistic avatars to its platforms, too — something it’s talked about for some time. Earlier this year, the company’s CEO, Eric Yuan, used one during its quarterly call. The avatars will mime your actions on video and are useful when you are not “camera-ready,” Zoom said. However, there are deepfake risks involved with the misuse of personas that could see corporate IT departments scrambling to turn them off.\n\nThe feature is expected to be available to consumers by the end of the year.\n\nThe update will introduce the ability for hosts to use Zoom Clips, its asynchronous video tool, and AI avatars to greet people in waiting rooms and to explain the purpose of the meeting.\n\nAI will also aid in new live translation features.\n\nWhat’s more, Zoom is launching an upgraded web interface to feature its AI companion more prominently, and other AI-powered features like a writing assistant to draft emails and documents, and a deep research feature, are being added.\n\nPlus, Zoom will allow for the creation of custom AI agents with support for Model Context Protocol (MCP), support for higher bit rate and 60fps for Zoom meetings, and a new Zoom video management tool to manage video assets.\n\nTopics\n\nIvan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

Users can share what they’re streaming with friends through a smartphone widget that works with a range of streaming services.\n\nOn Wednesday, Airbuds is announcing its raise of $5 million in funding from early-stage venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, founded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.\n\nThe startup has seen over 15 million app downloads up to this point, and has 5 million monthly active users, 1.5 million of whom launch the app daily. According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Airbuds also has a 96% positive ratings sentiment over the last 30 days across 9,400-plus ratings.\n\nFor users, the app offers a way to socialize and connect with their friends, engage in self-expression, and discover new tunes, all in one place.\n\nThat’s a combination that top music providers like Apple and Spotify have yet to figure out. Apple has tried and failed multiple times to integrate a social experience inside its music apps. That effort began with its disastrous music social network Ping, which closed down in the early 2010s, and was followed by a revamped attempt known as Connect, aimed at connecting artists and fans. (Connect also didn’t last.)\n\nSpotify, meanwhile, has been working to make its music streamer a more social app with additions like its TikTok-inspired feeds, comments, polls, and Q&As for podcasts, artist stories, collaborative playlists, a messaging feature, and more.\n\nYet neither company has found the sweet spot when it comes to offering a true social network, because building popular consumer social experiences can be difficult and unpredictable.\n\nFortunately for Airbuds co-founders Gilles Poupardin and Gawen Arab, they’ve had time to iterate on their ideas.\n\nPoupardin has been building products for consumers since his college days, including a Pinterest-like music bookmarking tool, a voice-controlled smart speaker (arriving just ahead of Amazon’s Echo debut), and a social audio app called Cappuccino that let friends make mini-podcasts together. Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the smart speaker with Poupardin and then later did a stint at Zenly, the social app maker that sold to Snap for $350 million in 2017.\n\nAfter the Cappuccio team sold the app and its related IP to a meditation studio called Sociaaal, the startup moved on to a widget-oriented app, resulting in Airbuds.\n\n“Because I built all of these music products in the past, I knew that when you ask the users to create a playlist or to do something, it’s a lot of effort,” explained Poupardin, in an interview with TechCrunch. He saw that iOS widgets, which were still relatively new to the iPhone at the time, were popular with teens. That led him to think about building a widget that would show you what songs your friends were streaming.\n\n“Basically, it’s effortless. You just connect your Spotify, and then every time you’re going to listen to something on Spotify, it’s going to be shared on Airbuds in real time,” he says.\n\nToday, Airbuds supports Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, Musi, Deezer, Amazon Music, and Audiomack.\n\nWhile Airbuds’ core functionality remains the widget, the app has built on top of that experience to offer a range of other social features.\n\nUsers can react to their friends’ streamed songs with emojis, stickers, or selfies clipped out from photos with the background removed. As users scroll the app’s feed, they can play clips of their friends’ streamed songs and even chat with a friend through a simple, built-in messenger. When you want to stream your music but not share it, there’s a “ghost mode” option to keep your listening private until it’s disabled.\n\nAirbuds will also display friends with similar music tastes and deliver a personalized Weekly Recap of what you streamed, like a miniature version of Spotify’s popular year-end review, Spotify Wrapped. And it’s experimenting with a new feature that would let users join their school on the app to see the music top artists from their schoolmates.\n\nUsers can also customize their profile (or “Space”) by adding favorite artists, songs, albums, lyrics, pictures, text, and more, or let the app automatically design it for them.\n\nThis self-expression feature is key to the app’s traction, Poupardin believes, as around 30% of users now engage with the app’s features beyond just seeing what friends are streaming.\n\nThe streamers, he said, “gave us access to 100 million songs, but nobody really cracked the identity piece, the self-expression piece…and this is exactly how they use it,” referring to Airbuds’ young users, who are mostly high schoolers and college students in the U.S. (The app also has some traction in the U.K., Australia, Brazil, and Mexico.)\n\nHowever, some of Airbuds’ traction can be chalked up to its feature-gating, which requires users to invite friends to gain access to some of the app’s functionality. For example, you have to invite friends to see more than your top 3 artists in the recap. But Poupardin stresses it’s not just for growth — the app only really works if you add your friends.\n\nWith the new funding in hand, Airbuds is planning other ways to expand its app, potentially by supporting other types of streaming services, providing artist-to-fan connections, or designing features to attract older users. The team is also testing a subscription feature.\n\nTo date, the startup has raised a total of $10 million from investors including a16z, SV Angel, Dream Machine, Nikita Bier, Antoine Martin, Uncommon, and Night Capital.\n\nAirbuds is available on iOS and Android.\n\nTopics\n\nConsumer News Editor\n\nFounders: land your investor and sharpen your pitch.

The company is updating Seller Assistant, its AI tool for third-party sellers, to help handle tasks on the seller’s behalf.\n\n“Our agentic AI capabilities are designed to work seamlessly throughout the entire selling experience, which means sellers can go from handling every task themselves to collaborating with an intelligent assistant that works proactively on their behalf around the clock, while always keeping sellers in control,” Amazon wrote in a press release. “Seller Assistant will be able to handle everything from routine operations to complex business strategy, so sellers can focus on innovation and growth.”\n\nSeller Assistant can now not only monitor account health and inventory, but also help develop strategies and take action when authorized, Amazon says.\n\nFor example, when a seller is reviewing their inventory, Seller Assistant will flag slow-moving products before they incur long-term storage fees and recommend whether it would make sense to leave the item as it is, lower the price, or remove it altogether. Seller Assistant will also be able to analyze demand patterns and prepare shipment recommendations.\n\nSeller Assistant continuously monitors a seller’s account and flag potential issues and actions, such as inventory listings that might violate new product safety regulations. Additionally, it can automatically ensure that all of a seller’s products meet compliance requirements in every country they’re selling in.\n\nAgent-driven commerce is an area of intense interest for tech companies, which imagine a future in which agents can initiate deals or make purchases on behalf of their clients. On Tuesday, Google released a new payments protocol for agentic transactions, although Amazon was not named as a partner.\n\nAmazon also announced that it’s bringing agentic AI to advertising, allowing sellers to develop ads through conversational prompts.\n\nToday’s announcement marks the latest AI tools that Amazon has rolled out for third-party sellers on its platform. Other tools include a video generator for ads and a generative AI tool that helps merchants improve their product listings.\n\nTopics\n\nConsumer News Reporter\n\nAisha is a consumer news reporter at TechCrunch.

It said the hackers exfiltrated data from Insight’s servers and began encrypting the systems on January 16, 2025, a hallmark of a ransomware attack.\n\nInsight separately also told the Maine attorney general this week in an official notice that the ransomware attack affects more than 12,600 people.\n\nNeither of the data breach notification letters disclosed what specific personal data was taken from Insight’s systems.\n\nBut according to the company’s earlier statement, the stolen data included information about certain Insight Partners’ funds, management companies, and portfolio companies. The hackers also took banking and tax information, the company said, as well as personal information about its current and former employees and its limited partners — the typically private and unnamed investors who help provide capital to Insight’s venture funds.\n\nInsight Partners has said little else about the data breach, such as whether the company received an extortion demand from the hackers or if it paid the hackers. (It’s not uncommon for companies to face demands for payment in exchange for the hackers deleting or not publishing the stolen data.)\n\nKristen Zeck, a spokesperson for Insight Partners, did not respond to emails with questions about the breach sent prior to publication.\n\nThe company has more than $90 billion in assets under its management and has invested in some of the largest cybersecurity companies today, including Databricks and Wiz.\n\nInsight Partners joins a handful of other venture firms in recent years to have been hacked.\n\nSilicon Valley venture firm Advanced Technology Ventures was hit by a ransomware attack in 2021, the same year that Sequoia Partners experienced a data breach. Both incidents allowed hackers to swipe personal information of their firms’ limited partners.\n\nUpdated on September 17 with additional details about the ransomware attack.\n\nTopics\n\nSecurity Editor\n\nZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

Shen Ming Lee decided to start a company.\n\n“I grew up in the conventional palm oil industry,” Lee told TechCrunch. “My family’s business is one of the top producers in the palm oil space. And so I grew up a little bit — I have to admit —ashamed of what my family does.”\n\nPalm oil has come to dominate the market for vegetable oils, with the raw ingredient and its derivatives appearing in everything from snack foods and cosmetics to pharmaceuticals and biofuels. But along the way, it has deforested vast swaths of the tropics, especially in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe germ of Lee’s startup, Terra Oleo, emerged in 2022 when she met co-founder Boon Uranukul, who, as a doctoral candidate at MIT, had developed microbes that could produce building blocks of plastics using agricultural waste.\n\n“I really had this desire to build something that was maybe going to build on my family’s legacy, but in a way that was more in line with my values as a Gen Z, sustainability-leading person,” Lee said. “We got thinking about what we could do differently, matching his expertise with my connections and strategic network.”\n\nThe Singapore-based startup has been operating in stealth for nearly two years to develop microbes that can transform agricultural waste into a variety of oils.\n\nTerra Oleo has raised $3.1 million from ADB Ventures, Better Bite Ventures, Elev8.vc, The Radical Fund, a strategic corporate investor from the palm oil industry, and other investors, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. Lee and Uranukul are also part of this year’s Breakthrough Energy Fellows cohort.\n\nPalm oil can be refined into dozens of derivatives, so Lee and Uranukul mapped them to determine where to begin. “What are the most high value ones? But also technologically, what’s easier for us to tackle and lower hanging fruit?” Lee said.\n\n“There’s the illusion that crude palm oil is the end all be all,” she said, adding that the raw ingredient is a “very low margin commodity.” Instead, they decided to skip straight to higher-value products, including cocoa butter and speciality oils used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nTo make those oils, the company selected three yeast species based on the microbes’ abilities to produce certain oils when fed with organic waste, including from agriculture and biodiesel production. It then used genetic and metabolic engineering to boost and tune their ability to produce certain fats and triglycerides.\n\nCurrently, the company is still in the lab, producing grams of oil at a time. But Lee said that Terra Oleo plans to use the funding to produce kilograms worth of the stuff.\n\nAlready, Terra Oleo can produce oils for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries at costs far less than what they sell for. That’s mostly because the startup’s microbes produce the right chemical from the start, eliminating the need for pricey refining.\n\n“We’re looking at upwards of 80% margins for some of these specialty oleochemicals because they’re really expensive to produce conventionally,” Lee said.\n\nHitting the scale needed to replace significant amounts of palm oil won’t be easy. Last season, the world produced nearly 79 million metric tons, according to the USDA, though the market hasn’t grown significantly in the past six years.\n\nFor Lee, that’s an opportunity to show existing palm oil producers that maybe there’s another path.\n\n“We’re not going to change from palm oil to other sources overnight,” she said. “It’s so prevalent, it’s such a versatile ingredient that I think it’s going to be a slow transition where we’re working with the industry to get to that diversified production mix that we want to see.”\n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter, Climate\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch. He has written for a wide range of publications, including Wired magazine, the Chicago Tribune, Ars Technica, The Wire China, and NOVA Next, where he was founding editor.\n\nDe Chant is also a lecturer in MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing, and he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT in 2018, during which time he studied climate technologies and explored new business models for journalism.

The Alphabet-owned company has previously announced plans to bring its robotaxis to Miami, Washington D.C., Dallas, and Denver.\n\nThe deal also illustrates Waymo’s desire to move beyond being a sole operator and towards being an autonomous vehicle technology provider. Earlier this year, Waymo launched a robotaxi service with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. Under that arrangement, Waymo is responsible for vehicle testing, roadside assistance, and certain aspects of rider support, while Uber manages fleet services such as vehicle cleaning, maintenance, inspections, charging, and depot operations through a company called Moove Cars.\n\nWaymo’s arrangement with Lyft in Nashville is similar. Lyft will also handle fleet services, such as vehicle readiness and maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations through its wholly owned subsidiary Flexdrive. Lyft said it’s investing in a purpose-built AV facility to support the fleet.\n\nThe Waymo-Lyft partnership in Nashville has one key difference from the company’s relationship with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. In Nashville, robotaxi customers will be able to access robotaxis in two ways. Users will initially hail rides directly through the Waymo app. Once the service expands, Waymo will also dispatch its autonomous vehicles for matched rides on the Lyft app.\n\nThat’s unlike its partnership with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. In those cities, all potential customers have to use the Uber app in hopes of being matched with a robot, not a human driver.\n\nLyft and Waymo have partnered before, although never at scale. In 2019, Waymo linked up with Lyft to bring a handful of self-driving vehicles onto the ride-hailing network in Phoenix as the company ramped up its commercial robotaxi service.\n\nTopics\n\nTransportation Editor\n\nFounders: land your investor and sharpen your pitch.

(0:40)\n\nThe Nov. 14 showdown between Jake Paul and Gervonta Davis has relocated from Georgia to neighboring Florida, ESPN learned on Wednesday. The clash -- which will be livestreamed on Netflix -- will now take place at the Kaseya Center in Miami after originally being slated for State Farm Arena in Atlanta.\n\n\"New city, same mission, seek and destroy the tank,\" said Paul in a statement to ESPN. \"Kaseya Center. Friday, November 14. I'm bringing the heat, and Miami will see me take down this angry elf while the world watches live on Netflix.\"\n\n\"Jake Paul has been cherry picking in the sport of boxing for a while now, but he picked the wrong opponent this time,\" Davis added in a statement. \"He better start losing some weight, chasing some chickens, and pray that helps him some on fight night! Thank you to Netflix for giving me the opportunity to whoop this clown!\"\n\nThe venue change comes on the heels of USA Today's report that Most Valuable Promotions, co-founded by Jake Paul and Nakisa Bidarian, had withdrawn their request for event permits and rule waivers required to hold the event in Georgia. Rick Thompson, chairman of the Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission (GAEC), told USA Today that the promotional outfit was \"promoting something they should not have been.\"\n\nA pair of news conferences set for Sept. 17 in New York and Sept. 18 in Atlanta have been rescheduled for Sept. 22 in New York and Sept. 23 in Miami.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we made the decision to withdraw the event from Georgia after several interviews conducted by Commissioner Rick Thompson, who seems to have a personal agenda, publicly misrepresenting the facts and undermining what was set to be a massive event for Atlanta, featuring multiple world championship bouts and the launch of efforts to revitalize world-class boxing in Georgia,\" Bidarian told ESPN. \"No tickets were ever on sale, and every step of this process was coordinated in close communication with the Commission's Executive Director. This event would have delivered significant value to the city, the state, and the sport.\"\n\nThe biggest point of contention surrounding the fight has been over the weight limit for the fight. Paul most recently competed at cruiserweight and weighed in at 199.4 pounds for his June fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. while Davis tipped the scales at 133.8 pounds in March when he battled Lamont Roach Jr. to a majority draw. Bidarian told ESPN that those details will be revealed next week.\n\n\"From the outset we were clear with GAEC on the agreement between the fighters, which is what the matchup will be,\" Bidarian said. \"We will share details next week at our New York press conference.\""}

He finished with two sacks in eight games last season for the Steelers.\n\nAt 6-foot-5 and 265 pounds, Smith offers versatility; he can rush from the end or inside as well as from a stand-up position.

Here's everything you need to know about the men's javelin throw competition at the World Championships:\n\nThere are 37 athletes in action in the men's javelin throw qualification, including four Indians - Neeraj Chopra, Sachin Yadav, Rohit Yadav and Yash Vir Singh.\n\nThe 37 athletes are split into two groups. Neeraj and Sachin are in Group A, alongside 17 others including Julian Weber, Keshorn Walcott and Jakub Vadlejch. Action in Group A will begin at 3:40pm IST on September 17.\n\nRohit and Yash Vir are in Group B, alongside 16 others including Olympic champion Arshad Nadeem, Anderson Peters and Luiz Mauricio da Silva. Action in Group B will begin at 5:15pm IST on September 17.\n\nThe final begins at 3:53pm IST on Thursday, September 18. [The Worlds are being telecast on JioHotstar]\n\nThe automatic qualification mark is 84.50m.\n\nAny athlete who throws beyond that mark will qualify for the final. A minimum of the 12 from the two groups combined will make it through to the final.\n\nSo, if an athlete doesn't throw more than 84.50m in qualification, he would need to be in the top 12 to secure his place in the final. If more than 12 athletes throw farther than 84.50m, then all of them make the final.\n\nAll the finalists have three throws to start with, at which point the competition is cut to only the top eight throwers, from where the throwing order changes to be in descending order of their standings.\n\nNeeraj finished second in Eugene in 2022, behind a monstrous performance from Anderson Peters who had three 90m+ throws in that final.\n\nIn Budapest in 2023, with Peters missing, Neeraj won the competition with a throw of 88.17m, 45cm further than Nadeem, who finished second, ahead of the Czech Jakub Vadlejch.\n\nIf Neeraj Chopra is to defend his World Championship in crown in Tokyo, it will likely have to be with the best throw of his life.\n\nYou see, going into these Worlds he isn't the favourite for it. That tag rests solely on the shoulders of the German Julian Weber. He's had a storming year so far, crossing 90m three times already in 2025. In his last competition - the Diamond League final in Zurich - Weber bettered his personal best twice, with his first two throws traveling 91.37m and 91.51m.\n\nFor Neeraj, the year began in promising fashion at the Doha Diamond League, where he crossed 90m for the first time in his career, even though he finished second to Weber on that day. Since then, he hasn't quite managed to consistently achieve marks in the high 80s, as he's so used to doing. He's won three major events this year - the Golden Spike Meet in Ostrava, the Paris Diamond League, and the Neeraj Chopra Classic in Bengaluru. Only in Paris was his winning throw farther than 88m.\n\nIt is a cause for concern for Neeraj and his coach Jan Zelezny. In the last few years, the consistency of finding throws in the range of 89m has been Neeraj's biggest strengths. It's why he has finished in the top two in each of the last 26 events that he has competed in.\n\nPerhaps, it is the quest to push himself to the limit knowing that Weber and Nadeem seem capable of hitting 90+ at will that is compromising Neeraj's technique. But one thing is for sure, if he can't manage to get back to his comfort zone around the 89m mark, it's more likely than not that he will return from Tokyo without a medal.\n\nNadeem hasn't yet hit the heights of his Olympic gold winning performance in 2025 yet, but he has never been one to need too many competition outings to find the big marks at world events. Apart from Weber, Brazil's Luiz Mauricio da Silva has also crossed the 91m mark this year, so he also presents a challenge to Neeraj. The gauntlet has been thrown down. Can Neeraj take it up?"}

Thick clouds of smoke can be seen as Israeli forces fire artillery shells and smoke bombs to cover their advance.\n\nThe Sheikh Radwan district was home to tens of thousands of people before the war and is considered one of the city's most densely populated areas.\n\nIsrael says the aim of its Gaza City offensive is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's \"last stronghold\" - but the operation has drawn widespread international condemnation.\n\nThe leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that \"the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable\".\n\nResidents in Sheikh Radwan said Wednesday's incursion followed a wave of heavy airstrikes targeting buildings and main streets across the neighbourhood, in what appeared to be preparation for the ground assault.\n\nSaad Hamada, a local resident who fled south with his family earlier on Wednesday, told the BBC: \"The drones didn't leave anything. They hit solar panels, power generators, water tanks, even the internet network.\n\n\"Life became impossible, and that is what forced most people to leave despite the danger.\"\n\nSheikh Radwan includes the areas of Abu Iskandar, al-Tawam, and al-Saftawi, and is intersected by al-Jalaa Street, a vital artery linking central Gaza City with its northern districts.\n\nLocals say Israeli control of the neighbourhood could open the way for forces to advance deeper into the city and reach its central areas.\n\nThe images of tanks in Gaza City's streets have caused widespread panic among residents, particularly those still living in the western and central parts of the city.\n\nWitnesses said the sight of tanks approaching their homes revived memories of previous incursions, that ended with entire neighbourhoods being flattened.\n\nThe incursion into Sheikh Radwan has triggered yet another wave of displacement, with thousands of families fleeing south.\n\nLong lines of cars and carts loaded with belongings were seen on the roads, as the Israeli army opened a route to the south via the Salahedin Road. Residents reported journeys taking hours and costing hundreds of shekels due to the scarcity of transport and soaring prices.\n\nBefore the war, Sheikh Radwan was one of Gaza City's busiest districts, home to dozens of schools, mosques, and marketplaces.\n\nIt had already been struck repeatedly by air raids in recent months, and there is widespread destruction, but the sight of tanks inside the area now marks a significant new phase in Israel's ground campaign.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Wednesday morning that it had struck more than 150 targets across Gaza City in two days in support of its ground troops.\n\nAs part of its operations, the IDF is also reportedly utilising old military vehicles loaded with explosives that have been modified to be controlled remotely. They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media.\n\nResident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: \"Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn.\"\n\n\"Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night.\"\n\nAid groups, UN agencies and others say the \"humanitarian area\" people are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it.\n\nSome who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents,  so they returned north.\n\n\"Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction,\" Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. \"But where can we go? We have no refuge in the south.\"\n\nThe IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nAt least 65,062 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nIt said on Wednesday that 98 people had been killed and 385 injured by Israeli fire in the past 24 hours.

He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.\n\nAt the time of his death he had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to a penal colony in the Arctic Circle.\n\nNavalny's supporters and colleagues at his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have always maintained the Russian government was involved in his demise.\n\nNavalnaya said that after her husband's death in February 2024 his team were able to \"obtain and securely transfer\" biological samples abroad and that two laboratories in different countries had concluded he had been poisoned.\n\nShe did not share the location of the laboratories - but she implied that they were not making their findings public due to \"political considerations\".\n\n\"They don't want an inconvenient truth to surface at the wrong time,\" she said.\n\nNavalnaya also suggested she would get pushback on trying to investigate her husband's death further: \"'You are the wife, of course, but there is no criminal case, there are no legal grounds to hand documents to you.'\"\n\n\"But I have grounds. Not legal, but moral grounds.\"\n\nShe added that Navalny had been her husband, friend and closest person – and \"a symbol of hope for a better future for our country\".\n\n\"I know he was a symbol to you too,\" she said over images of Navalny's Moscow funeral which drew thousands despite warnings from the authorities not to attend.\n\n\"I will not be silent. I affirm that Vladimir Putin is guilty of killing my husband, Alexei Navalny... I urge the laboratories which conducted studies to make the results public.\"\n\nOn Wednesday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of Navalnaya's statements.\n\nIn the video, Navalnaya also detailed her husband's last days based on what she said was testimony by employees at the penal colony, which the BBC has not been able to verify.\n\nAccording to her, on the day he died Navalny was taken out for a walk but felt ill. When he was taken back to his cell \"he lay down on the floor, pulled his knees up, and started moaning in pain... then he started vomiting\".\n\n\"Alexei was having convulsions... the prison guards watched [his] agony through the bars of the cell window,\" she said, citing the alleged testimonies.\n\nAn ambulance wasn't called until 40 minutes after Navalny became ill, his widow said, and he died shortly after. Prison authorities told his mother Lyudmila that her son had experienced \"sudden death syndrome\". Later, state investigators said the death had been caused by a medical condition and arrythmia.\n\nNavalny's associates have shared previously unseen images on social media purporting to show his cell on the day he died and the tiny exercise yard where he was allowed out.\n\nVladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".\n\nThe Russian president also said he had agreed to a planned prisoner swap between Navalny and \"some people\" held in Western jails, on condition that Navalny did not come back to Russia.\n\n\"But such is life. There's nothing to be done about it,\" Putin said.\n\nIt is highly unlikely Moscow will issue any further comment on Navalny's death.\n\nHis popularity and internet savviness long rattled the Kremlin, while senior figures were irritated by his investigations into high-profile government corruption.\n\nWith Navalny's death Russia lost the last towering opposition figure who challenged Putin's rule.\n\nMany of his associates have been jailed or have fled Russia. Navalnaya herself faces arrest, and she and her two children live abroad.\n\nThe crackdown on civil society ramped up further following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and punitive new laws leading to mass arrests have muzzled any opposition.\n\nIn both life and death Navalny managed to draw out huge crowds onto the streets. Thousands of mourners turned out for his funeral in Moscow in March 2024 despite well-founded fears of a police crackdown.\n\nNo large opposition gatherings have taken place in Russia since."}

Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty.\n\nUtah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said Robinson had sent text messages which allegedly said he shot Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\".\n\nBefore Robinson was captured, top Trump allies pinned blame for the killing on left-wing activists and rhetoric from Democratic lawmakers and their supporters.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has suggested that the administration will crack down on \"hate speech\" – although there is no specific US hate speech law. Vice-President JD Vance has led calls to expose people who celebrated or condoned Kirk's killing or were critical of him after his slaying.\n\n\"Call them out, and hell, call their employer,\" Vance said as he guest-hosted Kirk's podcast.\n\nSpeaking in Erie, Pennsylvania, Obama said: \"I think at moments like this, when tensions are high, then part of the job of the president is to pull people together.\"\n\nHe urged Americans to \"respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with\".\n\nObama praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox, a conservative Republican who he said had shown \"that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate\".\n\nHe also endorsed the response of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, whose official residence was firebombed earlier this year in what police called a targeted attack.\n\nThe former president contrasted those reactions with comments made by Trump and his allies.\n\nObama said that he did not use a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist at a black church in South Carolina to go after his political enemies, and pointed out that after the 11 September 2001 attacks, President George W Bush \"explicitly went out of his way to say, 'We are not at war against Islam'.\"\n\n\"And so when I hear not just our current president, but his aides, who have a history of calling political opponents 'vermin', enemies who need to be 'targeted,' that speaks to a broader problem that we have right now and something that we're going to have to grapple with, all of us,\" Obama told the crowd, according to reports.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, a White House spokesperson rejected the allegations and accused Obama of stoking division while he was president.\n\n\"Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"His division has inspired generations of Democrats to slander their opponents as 'deplorables,' or 'fascists,' or 'Nazis.'\"\n\nAfter leaving office, US presidents generally tend to temper criticism of their successors, however in recent months Obama has hit out at Trump's moves against universities and judges, and has also criticised Democratic party leaders for failing to push back harder against White House policies."}

I'm excited,\" he said.\n\nThe AI model was initially developed using anonymous UK data - including hospital admissions, GP records and lifestyle habits such as smoking - collected from more than 400,000 people as part of the UK Biobank research project.\n\nThe model was then tested to see if its predictions stacked up using data from other Biobank participants, and then with 1.9 million people's medical records in Denmark.\n\n\"It's good, it's really good in Denmark,\" says Prof Birney.\n\n\"If our model says it's a one-in-10 risk for the next year, it really does seem like it turns out to be one in 10.\"\n\nThe model is best at predicting diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart attacks and sepsis that have a clear disease progression, rather than more random events like infections.\n\nPeople are already offered a cholesterol-lowering statin based on a calculation of their risk of a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThe AI tool is not ready for clinical use, but the plan is to use it in a similar way, to spot high-risk patients while there is an opportunity to intervene early and prevent disease.\n\nThis could include medicines or specific lifestyle advice - such as people likely to develop some liver disorders benefitting from cutting back their alcohol intake more than the general population.\n\nThe artificial intelligence could also help inform disease-screening programmes and  analyse all the healthcare records in an area to anticipate demand - such as how many heart attacks a year there will be in Norwich in 2030, to help plan resources.\n\n\"This is the beginning of a new way to understand human health and disease progression,\" said Prof Moritz Gerstung, head of the division of AI in oncology at DKFZ, the German Cancer Research Centre.\n\nHe added: \"Generative models such as ours could one day help personalise care and anticipate healthcare needs at scale.\"\n\nThe AI model, described in the scientific journal Nature, needs refining and testing before it is used clinically.\n\nThere are also potential biases as it was built from UK Biobank data which is drawn mostly from people aged 40 to 70, rather than the whole population.\n\nThe model is now being upgraded to account for more medical data such as imaging, genetics and blood analysis.\n\nBut Prof Birney says: \"Just to stress, this is research – everything needs to be tested and well-regulated and thought about before it's used, but the technology is here to make these kinds of predictions.\"\n\nHe anticipates it will follow a similar path to the use of genomics in healthcare where it took a decade to go from scientists being confident in the technology to healthcare being able to use it routinely.\n\nThe study was a collaboration between the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) and the University of Copenhagen.\n\nProf Gustavo Sudre, a neuroimaging and AI researcher at King's College London, commented: \"This research looks to be a significant step towards scalable, interpretable, and – most importantly – ethically responsible form of predictive modelling in medicine.\""}

Brückner wasn't visible in the car but police confirmed he had left Sehnde prison.\n\nHe had been convicted of raping a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005, and will be fitted with an ankle tag after his release from the prison near the northern city of Hanover.\n\nThe German national, 48, has never been charged with any crime in relation to the McCann case. He denies any involvement.\n\nLocal police spokesman Lars Dehnert told the BBC: \"We said before that we wanted this to happen as smoothly as possible\", adding that Brückner would be escorted for a short distance.\n\n\"With this our police operation has terminated\", he added.\n\n\"We don't have any knowledge about where Christian B is going to go.

She and her siblings had been left sleeping in a holiday apartment while her parents, Kate and Gerry, went to a nearby restaurant.\n\nHer disappearance has become one of the highest-profile unsolved missing person cases in the world.\n\nGerman prosecutors have pointed to evidence - including mobile phone data - indicating Brückner may have been in the area when Madeleine vanished, and have consistently insisted that they think he is responsible.\n\nHowever, they have not found strong enough evidence to bring charges.\n\nNevertheless, Brückner has been handed strict release terms by a regional court at the request of prosecutors who fear their suspect could flee beyond their jurisdiction.\n\nHe will wear an electronic ankle monitor for five years as part of his probationary supervision, prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters told the BBC.\n\nHe must also contact a probation officer at least once a month and get court approval of any change of residence, the prosecutor said.\n\nMr Wolters recently said that \"the psychiatric expert assumes that due to his personality, there is a justified risk (that Brückner) will commit crimes again\".\n\nChristian Brückner, who spent many years in the Algarve, was a drifter, a petty criminal and a convicted sex offender. He has several previous convictions, including for sexually abusing children in 1994 and 2016.\n\nPortuguese and German police conducted a fresh search between where the McCanns had been staying and addresses linked to Brückner in June this year, but this yielded no breakthroughs.\n\nIn 2023, investigators carried out searches near the Barragem do Arade reservoir, about 30 miles (48km) from Praia da Luz.\n\nBrückner spent time in the Praia da Luz area between 2000 and 2017 and had photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir.\n\nIn October last year, he was cleared of unrelated sexual offences by a German court, alleged to have taken place in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.\n\nDue to differences in legal systems, German authorities suspect Brückner of murder in relation to Madeleine McCann, while British police continue to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case.\n\nThe funding given to the Met's investigation, Operation Grange, has totalled more than £13.2m since 2011. A further £108,000 was secured from the government in April."}

However, the violence has continued.\n\nAdditional reporting by Mariama Soumana in Niamey\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"}
