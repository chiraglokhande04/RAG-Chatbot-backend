Police had been searching for the couple for 53 days after officers found evidence of a recent birth in a burnt-out car near Bolton.\n\nPassing sentence, Judge Mark Lucraft KC told the couple \"neither of you gave much thought to the care or welfare of your baby\" and said there had been \"no genuine expression of remorse\" from either of them.\n\nThey were sentenced on the basis Victoria died of hypothermia - both defendants had argued against that during the hearing.\n\nGordon will serve a further four years on extended licence, the judge said. There was no reaction from either defendant as they were sentenced.\n\nThe first trial found Marten and Gordon guilty of concealing the birth of a child, perverting the course of justice by not reporting her death, and of child cruelty, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the manslaughter charge.\n\nThe court heard that, whem Marten was heavily pregnant, they had decided to live off grid to avoid Victoria being taken off them by social care authorities. Their four other children had previously been taken into care.\n\nDuring the police manhunt that spanned different parts of England once the circumstances of the birth were uncovered, the couple slept outside and took steps to avoid being found, such as taking long taxi rides that criss-crossed the country.\n\nThey were eventually located on 27 February 2023, and Victoria was discovered dead two days later in an allotment shed in the Hollingbury area of Brighton.\n\nShe had died while the couple were living in a tent on the South Downs in January that year.\n\nIn their trial, the couple had said Victoria's death was a tragic accident after Marten fell asleep holding the baby - but the prosecution called on evidence from experts on hypothermia, one of whom described the conditions the newborn would have experienced living in a tent in the middle of winter.\n\nDuring a months-long retrial, the judge said the couple tried to \"sabotage\" and \"manipulate\" proceedings.\n\nFirstly there were many days when one or other of them claimed illness, dental pain or just tiredness from travelling back and forth to court from their respective jail cells, causing proceedings to overrun by many months.\n\nWhen in court, both displayed disruptive and unpredictable behaviour, disrespected the judge, were rude to dock officers and would often talk during proceedings.\n\nOn one occasion, Judge Lucraft said about Marten that he has \"never had that sort of attitude\" shown to him by anyone in his 13 years as a full-time judge.\n\nDuring the latter stages of the retrial, Gordon parted company with his legal team and took on the role of representing himself in court, despite having no legal training.\n\nDisruption continued during Monday's sentencing hearing, during which the judge told off both defendants for passing notes in the dock. He told them it showed \"a complete lack of respect\".\n\nDuring mitigation, Marten's barrister Tom Godfrey told the court: \"The sorrow that Constance Marten feels is incalculable.\"\n\nHe added: \"She has, ever since an early stage, accepted that her baby died as a result of something she did. That fact weighs very heavily on her conscience and will do so for the rest of her life.\"\n\nPhilippa McAtasney KC, the barrister representing Gordon during the sentencing, said Gordon had told her \"I regret that things happened the way they happened\" and that he will \"live with this for the remainder of his life\".\n\nDuring the retrial, the jurors were told of Marten's privileged upbringing in a wealthy family. They also learned that Gordon had been convicted of rape in Florida in 1989 when he was aged 14.\n\nFor legal reasons, this conviction - for which he was sentenced to 40 years in prison and deported back to the UK after serving 20 years - was not made known during the first trial, but was disclosed the second time around.\n\nIn August, the Court of Appeal confirmed to the BBC it had received an application on behalf of Marten to appeal against her conviction."}

I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\"\n\nKruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform.\n\nSpeaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election.\n\nA few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, telling MPs in July: \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\"\n\nAsked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending.\n\n\"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"\n\nKruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024.\n\nReform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party.\n\nIn 2005, Kruger was working at Conservative campaign headquarters when he was selected as the Conservative candidate to stand against the then-prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nHowever, he stepped back over comments about wanting a \"period of creative destruction\" in public services.\n\nHis political jobs have included serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.\n\nA keen Brexiteer, Kruger described the Brexit vote as \"a heroic blow for a better model\". In May this year, he criticised Reform for \"piggybacking\" on the Tories' work during a debate on Brexit \"in a desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the Conservative party\".\n\nIn 2023, Kruger was one of the speakers at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\".\n\nKruger, the son of TV chef Prue Leith, is an old Etonian, and studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies and later a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute.\n\nA Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes – it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.\n\n\"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\".\n\n\"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said.\n\nGreen Party co-deputy leader Rachel Millward said Kruger's defection \"does serve as a loud alarm bell for the rest of us about the threats to this country if Reform UK were ever to form a government.\"\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."}

He now owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa - but he's unsure about its prospects.\n\n\"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\" says Mr Maxwell, who wears a baseball cap bearing the logo of a corn company.\n\nHe is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"Our yields, crops and weather are pretty good - but our [interest from] markets right now is on a low,\" he says. \"It's going to put stress on some farmers.\"\n\nHis fears are not unique. US agricultural groups warn that American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, mostly due to economic tensions with China. Since April, the two countries have been locked in a trade war, causing a sharp fall in the number of Chinese orders for American crops.\n\nAmerican farmers are wounded as a result, economists say. The number of small business bankruptcies filed by farmers has reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July.\n\nWith all this economic pain, rural areas could well have turned against Trump. But that doesn't seem to be happening.\n\nRural Americans were one of the president's most loyal voting blocs in last year's election, when he won the group by 40 percentage points over Kamala Harris, beating his own margins in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Research analysis.\n\nPolling experts say that in the countryside, he is still broadly popular.\n\nMr Maxwell says he is sticking with Trump, despite his own financial worries. \"Our president told us it was going to take time to get all these tariffs in place,\" he says.\n\n\"I am going to be patient. I believe in our president.\"\n\nSo why do so many farmers and other rural Americans broadly continue to back Trump even while feeling an economic squeeze that is driven in part by tariffs - the president's signature policy?\n\nIf you want a window into rural America, the Iowa State Fair is a good start. The agricultural show attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days.\n\nThere is candy floss; deep-fried hot dogs on a stick for $7 (£5) - known as \"corn dogs\"; an antique tractor show; a competition for the biggest boar.\n\nBut when the BBC visited last month, there was another topic of conversation: tariffs.\n\n\"A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,\" says Gil Gullickson, who owns a farm in South Dakota and edits an agriculture magazine.\n\n\"But I can say: history proves that tariffs don't end well.\"\n\nIn April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world, including a 145% tariff on China.\n\nIn response, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods - a blow to farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", many of whom sell crops to China.\n\nLast year Chinese companies bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of soybeans from America, mostly to feed their livestock.\n\nSeptember is harvest season, and the American Soybean Association (ASA) has warned that soybean orders from China are way below where they should be at this point in the year.\n\nTariffs have fluctuated dramatically since they were introduced - and the uncertainty is proving tough for farmers, says Christopher Wolf, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University.\n\n\"China is just so big that when they buy things, it matters - and when they don't, it matters.\"\n\nThe cost of fertiliser has rocketed, too - partly because of trade disputes with Canada, which has raised the cost of potash, a salt imported from Canada by American farmers and used in fertiliser.\n\nJon Tester, a former Democrat Senator of Montana, who is a third-generation farmer, told a US news station earlier this month: \"With all these tariffs the president's put on, it's interrupted our supply chain… it's increased the cost of new equipment… and because of the trade and tariffs, a lot of customers have said to heck with the United States…\n\n\"The people who are new to agriculture, those young farmers who haven't saved money for times like this, they're going to be in trouble and a lot of those folks are going to go broke.\n\n\"And if this continues, a lot of folks like me are going to go broke too.\"\n\nAmerican farmers already suffer from high levels of stress. They are more than three times more likely than average to die by suicide, according to a paper by a charity, the National Rural Health Association, which analysed a period before Trump's presidency.\n\nIn a letter to the White House, Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA, warned of a tipping point: \"US soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice.\"\n\nSupporters of President Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run, by forcing countries like China to come to the negotiating table and agree new deals with the US over agriculture.\n\nAnd they point to other ways this White House has helped farmers. Over the summer, as part of Trump's tax and spend bill, his administration expanded federal subsidies for farmers by $60bn (£44bn), and boosted funding for federal crop insurance.\n\nIn his annual speech to Congress in March, Trump warned farmers of a \"little bit of an adjustment period\" following the tariffs, adding: \"Our farmers are going to have a field day… to our farmers, have a lot of fun, I love you.\"\n\nSid Miller, commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, is among those who have praised Trump for his \"vital support\".\n\n\"We finally have an administration that is prioritising farmers and ranchers,\" he wrote in a statement earlier this year. \"They advocate for farmers, challenge China ... and ensure America's producers are receiving fair treatment.\"\n\nAnd it is possible the president's tariff strategy could eventually work, according to Michael Langemeier, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University.\n\nBut he also worries that uncertainty is inflicting long-term damage. \"Your trading partner doesn't know exactly what your position's going to be next year, because it seems like we're changing the goalposts.\n\n\"That is a problem.\"\n\nThere's an old adage in American politics that says people \"vote with their pocketbooks\" - and turn against politicians if they appear to harm their finances.\n\nYet despite financial pressures, the rural Americans we spoke to are firmly sticking with Trump.\n\nExperts say they haven't seen any evidence of meaningful change in support among rural voters since last year. A survey by Pew last month found that 53% of rural Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, far higher than the 38% figure for the country as a whole.\n\nThough a survey by ActiVote earlier this month did find a small decline in Trump's approval among rural voters from 59% in August to 54% in September. Analysts warn not to pay too much attention to those shifts, however, because the number of rural voters included in those polls is so small.\n\n\"The data I've seen suggests Trump is still heavily supported in rural communities,\" says Michael Shepherd, a political science professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on rural politics.\n\nFor some farmers at the state fair, the explanation is simple: they believe the US president when he tells them that tariffs will help them in the long run.\n\n\"We think the tariffs eventually will make us great again,\" says John Maxwell, a dairy farmer and cheese producer from Iowa.\n\n\"We were giving China a lot, and [previously] we paid tariffs when we sold to them. Let's make it fair. What's good for the goose is good for the other goose.\"\n\nSome may also hold onto hope that the president will bail farmers out. During Trump's first term he gave farmers a $28bn (£20.7bn) grant amid a tariff dispute with China.\n\nFor Nicholas Jacobs, a politics professor at Colby College and author of The Rural Voter, there's a deeper reason at play.\n\n\"It's easy for an outsider to ask, 'Why the hell are you still with this guy?'\" he says. \"But you have to understand that across rural America, the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump.\"\n\nStarting in the 1980s, he says, rural Americans started to feel alienated and left behind while cities benefited from globalisation and technological change.\n\nWhat he calls a \"rural identity\" formed, based on a shared grievance and an opposition to urban liberals. The Republicans seemed like their natural champion, while he says the Democrats became \"the party of the elite, technocrats, the well-educated, the urbane\".\n\nSome repeat that sentiment at the state fair. Joan Maxwell, a dairy farmer from Davenport in Iowa, says that her area is too often viewed as \"flyover country\".\n\n\"We are not looked at very positively for the most part from the media,\" she says. \"We've been called deplorables, uneducated,\" - a reference to Hillary Clinton's description of half of Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\".\n\nMs Maxwell added: \"A lot of times they ignore us or make fun of us.\"\n\nProf Shepherd, of Michigan University, believes there's another factor: in his view, America has become so polarised - with voters from both sides entrenched in their camps - that many are willing to forgive much more than they would previously, as long as it's a policy implemented by their own side.\n\nHe calls this \"selective blame attribution… they might be really angry about some things that are happening, but they're reticent to blame Trump for them.\"\n\nMr Wolf has his own view on the \"best case scenario\" from here. \"What I hope happens is that he [Trump] just declares victory and leaves it [tariffs] alone.\"\n\nBut he warns that even if the policy is dropped, the damage to American farmers could be long-term due to the shake-up to supply chains. Some Chinese firms are now buying their soybeans from Brazil rather than America, he says; they may not quickly return.\n\nMany of the analysts we spoke to believe that rural America's support for Trump is not a blank cheque, despite their current support.\n\nMr Shepherd points to the Great Depression and rural \"Dustbowl\" of the 1930s, which forced millions of farmers to migrate to American cities, causing a long-term realignment in politics - though nobody expects it to get anywhere near that bad this time. The farm crisis of the 1980s also saw thousands of farms go under.\n\nBack at the state fair, Ms Maxwell, the Iowan dairy farmer, makes this point clear.\n\n\"We're giving him the chance to follow through with the tariffs, but there had better be results. I think we need to be seeing something in 18 months or less.\n\n\"We understand risk - and it had better pay off.\"\n\nListen to Corn Belt People on BBC Radio 4 at 4pm bst on Monday 15 September\n\nAdditional reporting: Florence Freeman"}

They instead simply used some clever editing to made it look like they had been.\n\nOne of the many notable things about Netflix's Adolescence, which has just won several top prizes at the Emmy Awards, was that all four of its hour-long episodes really did involve filming everything in one go, without interruption.\n\nIt's a shooting technique which was widely praised for making the viewing experience more gripping and immersive when the series was released to huge acclaim in March.\n\nAudiences were instantly drawn in to the show's bracing depiction of a teenage boy who is accused of stabbing a female classmate. But the series was far more than another procedural crime drama.\n\nIts exploration of the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers captured the zeitgeist, tapping into the fears of parents around the world.\n\nThe drama's breakout star was Owen Cooper, a Warrington-born actor who was only 14 when the series was filmed.\n\nCooper played the central character, Jamie Miller, a schoolboy who is abruptly woken up by the police storming his house in the show's first episode.\n\nThey find him in his bedroom and place him under arrest. \"You're making a big mistake,\" insists the boy's dad, played by Stephen Graham, who also co-created the series with writer Jack Thorne.\n\nBut as the episode unfolds, it's clear there is no mistake. Damning CCTV evidence ultimately proves Jamie's guilt, and Adolescence begins to examine its key questions: what led to this murder, and what motive could a teenager possibly have had.\n\nIt was a storyline based on real events. \"I read an article about a young boy who'd stabbed a young girl to death, and it made me feel cold,\" Graham told Radio X's Chris Moyles.\n\nA similar but separate teen stabbing hit the headlines just a couple of months later. \"And these two incidents were at the opposite ends of the country,\" Graham noted.\n\n\"And I just thought, why is this happening? And not just because I'm a father, but I think any human being with a moral compass can look at that situation and think, what's going on with society today that we're in this era where these young boys are stabbing young girls to death?\"\n\nGraham knew the success of the show would hinge on the young actor chosen to play Jamie, and casting director Shaheen Baig struck gold with Cooper - who had first become interested in acting around the age of 10.\n\nIn a joint interview with Baig, Cooper explained: \"I don't know where it came from, but I asked my mum and dad if I could start going to drama classes, and I think they were a bit shocked by it because I've always wanted to become a footballer.\n\n\"I still play football now, and then asking them if I wanted to start drama lessons, it was a bit out of the blue, really.\"\n\nBaig recalled: \"It was really [about] trying to find somebody with the emotional register to be able to play Jamie.\n\n\"Owen sent us an improv tape, and I remember first watching that, and thinking, \"OK. He looks great on camera, but also his improv was really smart.\" It felt very natural.\"\n\nMany of the headlines surrounding Cooper claimed he had never acted before. But that wasn't actually true.\n\n\"It has frustrated us a bit,\" said drama teacher Esther Morgan, who helped run the weekly acting classes Cooper had attended for two years in Didsbury, Manchester.\n\nThe Adolescence team, she told BBC News in April, had approached the Drama MOB school while casting the series, asking to see tapes of their \"strongest northern boys\".\n\n\"They kept coming back for Owen,\" she recalled. \"He just had something.\"\n\nIt was true that Cooper didn't have any TV or film credits to his name, but not that he had never tried his hand at acting.\n\nIn fact, Morgan suggested Cooper's comfort with one-take shooting was partly due to the drama school's focus on improvisation.\n\nWhen the show launched, Morgan said: \"It felt amazing, but I didn't realise it would be as good as it was, I didn't expect it to be talked about so much.\"\n\nFor several weeks, the series dominated the news agenda, and eventually went on to become Netflix's second most watched English-language series ever (after the first season of Wednesday).\n\n\"We wanted to pose a question that got people talking on their sofas, in pubs, in schools, maybe even in parliament,\" Thorne said.\n\nThe government subsequently supported Netflix's proposal to make the drama available to schools. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was a need to tackle the \"emerging and growing problem\" the show raised.\n\nMany critics shared the sentiment in their reviews. \"If you're a parent to a school-age boy... it will chill your blood\" said the Telegraph's Anita Singh. It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\"\n\nClearly, Emmy voters didn't forget about it either. The show's impact was so undeniable that it was seen as the dead-cert for best limited series.\n\nEven Colin Farrell's painful months spent in a hot and heavy bodysuit and under acres of prosthetics for Batman spin-off The Penguin were no match for it.\n\nAdolescence's victory this year continues Netflix's winning streak, after another of their other watercooler hits, Baby Reindeer, took home several prizes in 2024.\n\nAdolescence might have highlighted the dangers of social media - but its success also owes something to it.\n\nSeveral scenes from the series went viral, from the initial arrest at the beginning to the camera that follows a pupil fleeing the classroom out of a window in episode two. Both moments were enhanced by the one-take shooting style.\n\n\"The choreography of camera and bodies, should you care to contemplate it, is remarkable, navigating crowds and corridors and public places with impossible grace,\" noted the LA Times.\n\n\"Long, uninterrupted scenes also allow a superb cast to dive into character and the moment.\"\n\nBut the show's third episode, a chamber piece where Jamie spends an hour with a child psychologist, was perhaps the highlight. Hardly any other characters appear as Briony (played by Erin Doherty) gently probes Jamie.\n\nCooper runs the full acting gauntlet - veering from vulnerable to furious, cocky to distraught. Bearing in mind that Cooper only appears on screen in two of Adolescence's four episodes, it was probably this performance which sealed his Emmy.\n\nBut the acting performances were praised across the board - with Doherty and Graham both winning for their respective roles, while the show also won awards for its writing and direction.\n\nAfter filming Adolescence, Cooper said he had decided \"that I'd do this happily for the rest of my life. I think Adolescence was the perfect start for me\".\n\n\"I think I did get very lucky to be a part of it,\" he continued. \"I just wanted to grab the opportunity with both hands. I went in there just wanting to learn. Wanting to do the job, really. And I'll take that into every other job that I'll ever, ever do.\"\n\nMuch like Mr Bates vs. The Post Office a year earlier, Adolescence was not only successful, but had a real-world impact. It was one of those rare success stories that TV executives dream of.\n\nYou can expect Adolescence to continue its awards momentum into next year, at the Golden Globe, SAG, and Bafta TV Awards.\n\nCooper had better get his Emmys tuxedo back to the dry-cleaners."}

So, you know, it's just, yeah, it just means a lot to me,\" Cooper said backstage after his win.\n\nBackstage, director Philip Barantini told reporters that they made the show in Yorkshire with the hope it would \"spark a bit of a conversation in the UK\" where knife crime has become a big issue, but added he could not have predicted its global success.\n\nThe Hollywood satire Seth Rogen co-created and stars in picked up several awards, completing an impressive run in its first season.\n\nRogen, who arrived backstage unable to carry all the trophies he had acquired, joked: it's \"getting embarrassing\".\n\nAlas, he did not thank his fictional right-hand man Sal Saperstein in his acceptance speech.\n\nIt came down to Severance's battle of the mind and The Pitt's battle of the heart in the best drama series category, with HBO's medical drama besting the top nominee.\n\nThe Pitt took home two major Emmy awards in a row, winning outstanding drama series and Noah Wyle winning best lead actor in a drama series, who called his win \"a dream\".\n\n\"I want to dedicate this, on behalf of everyone, to all the healthcare workers, front-line first responders. Respect them, protect them, trust them,\" show creator R Scott Gemmill said while accepting the award for best drama.\n\nBefore that, Katherine LaNasa also won the award for best supporting drama actress for her portrayal of a charge nurse, Dana, in the show.\n\nFirst-time host Nate Bargatze, known for his family-friendly humour, knocked it out of the park with his idea to keep winner speeches short: He started off the night with a $100,000 (£73,630) pledge to the Boys and Girls Club of North America that would be docked $1,000 for every second someone went over.\n\n\"It's hard. It's tough. It's brutal. I can't change it. This is a game I made up and these are the rules,\" he said in his opening monologue after explaining the idea.\n\nThe \"game\" ran throughout the telecast, with most winners ignoring it or promising to make up for how much money they lost the club. The check-ins throughout the night made for a consistent running gag.\n\nThe Studio star Seth Rogen kicked off the speeches and kept it speedy due to his shock at the win, adding another $6,000 to the roster. But his successor, The Pitt star Katherine LaNasa greatly overran, and had what Bargatze called \"a very expensive wave\" that lost the club several thousands of dollars.\n\nDuring a mid-show check-in the total was down to -$26,000 and Bargatze quipped that he's \"actually making money\".\n\nBut with Hollywood's love of a happy ending, Bargatze closed the show by pledging $250,000 and that network CBS would add on another $100,000.\n\nSeverance star Tramell Tillman, who plays the enigmatic Seth Milchick in Apple TV+'s mind-bending drama, became the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series in the award show's 77-year history.\n\nDuring his speech, Tillman dedicated the award to his mother, whom he described as his first acting coach.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the show, he also thanked the black actors nominated in the category before him, including Andre Braugher, Ossie Davis and Michael K Williams.\n\nHe said his character is a man that is aware of his race and place \"in the world of Lumon\" and was proud that he was able to \"elevate his story\" and \"practice authenticity\" on the show.\n\nColbert, whose late-night chat show The Late Show was cancelled by CBS earlier this year, offered up his vintage headshot and made a public plea for work when he took the stage as a presenter early in the telecast. He also received a standing ovation and rapturous chants of \"Stephen, Stephen!\"\n\n\"I want to thank CBS for giving us the privilege of being part of the late night tradition, which I hope continues long after we're no longer doing this show,\" he said when he won the prize for outstanding talk series.\n\nBackstage, Colbert said he didn't yet have plans for his next big move, just that he was eager to get back to work on Tuesday.\n\nHannah Einbinder of Hacks made one of the first major political statements of the telecast, closing her speech by condemning US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shouting \"Free Palestine\".\n\nElaborating on her comments about the war in Gaza backstage afterwards, Einbinder said it was her \"obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the State of Israel.\"\n\nDays before the show, a group called Film Workers for Palestine proposed a boycott of what it called \"complicit Israeli film institutions and companies\" as more in Hollywood have spoken up against the war. Paramount - CBS' parent company - denounced the proposal and became the first major Hollywood studio to take a stance on the conflict.\n\nSignatories of the petition included Oscar-winner Javier Bardem, nominated for his role as Jose Menendez in Netflix's Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.

Anything can be possible. I was nothing about three years ago, I'm here now.\"\n\nHe also thanked his family, co-stars, and the show's production team, adding: \"It may have my name on this award, but it really belongs to the people behind the camera.\"\n\nCooper broke the record previously held by Scott Jacoby, who was 16 years old when he won a Primetime Emmy in 1973 for That Certain Summer.\n\nRoxana Zal remains the youngest acting winner overall. She was 14 when she won an Emmy in 1984 for Something About Amelia. Bindi Irwin is the youngest person to have won a Daytime Emmy, when she was nine.\n\nAdolescence was widely praised by critics and viewers for its exploration of the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers.\n\nIn his acceptance speech for leading actor, Graham said: \"This kind of thing normally doesn't happen to a kid like me, I'm just a mixed-race kid from a block of flats in a place called Kirkby.\n\n\"So for me to be here today in front of my peers and be acknowledged by you is the most humbling thing I could ever imagine in my life, and it shows you that any dream is possible.\"\n\nDoherty, who played a child psychologist who works with Jamie, won best supporting actress in a limited series.\n\nThe British actress joked she would be \"banging on about Owen Cooper and Adolescence for the rest of my life\".\n\n\"I'd love to mention every single person involved in making this show because it was the definition of a team effort,\" she added.\n\nAccepting the prize for outstanding writing earlier in the night, Graham said: \"We never expected our little programme to have such a big impact, but we're really grateful that it did.\"\n\nHis co-writer Jack Thorne paid tribute to the show's young cast, telling them: \"You are the flame that proved young people are going to be OK.\"\n\nEarlier in the weekend, actor Jake Gyllenhaal surprised Cooper during an interview, after the young actor previously described him as his hero.\n\nIn a clip that went viral on social media, Gyllenhaal gave Cooper the \"lucky duck\" which had originally been given to him when he was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nOther winners at the Emmys included Hollywood satire The Studio, which won several of the major comedy categories, including best actor for its star and creator Seth Rogen.\n\nThe actor joked: \"I couldn't wrap my head around this happening, so I've prepared nothing.\n\n\"I never won anything in my life. When I was a kid I bought a used bowling trophy at an estate sale. This is really just so lovely.\"\n\nThe Studio broke the record for the most wins by a comedy for a single series, winning 13 awards in total including those it took home at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys.\n\nJean Smart repeated her win for best leading actress in a comedy for her performance in the satirical Hacks.\n\nHer co-star Hannah Einbinder also won an acting prize for the first time, taking home best supporting actress in a comedy.\n\nEinbinder thanked Smart and the show's crew for \"changing my life in every conceivable way\".\n\nOn a night were several celebrities made direct or indirect references to the Israel-Gaza war, Einbinder finished her speech by saying: \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nMedical drama The Pitt won the prestigious best drama series award, while its stars Katherine LaNasa and Noah Wyle were recognised with individual acting prizes.\n\nBut there were also wins in the drama categories for sci-fi thriller Severance, with acting prizes awarded to Britt Lower and Tramell Tillman, who became the first black winner of best supporting actor in a drama.\n\nTillman dedicated his award to his mother, who he said was his \"first acting coach\".\n\n\"Mama, you were there for me when no-one else was, and no-one else would show up,\" he said. \"Your love and kindness stays with me, and this is for you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Stephen Colbert won outstanding talk series, weeks after it was announced his show was being cancelled.\n\nHis win came after a recent campaign, led by some of his fellow nominees such as Jimmy Kimmel, which encouraged Academy voters to support Colbert in the category this year.\n\n\"Thank you for this honour,\" Colbert said. \"I want to thank CBS for giving us to be art of the privilege of late-night tradition, which I hope continues long after we've stopped doing this show.\"\n\nColbert also received a standing ovation while presenting an award earlier in the night. He joked: \"While I have your attention, is anyone hiring? Because I've got 200 very well qualified candidates here with me tonight, who will be available in June.\"\n\nElsewhere, the US version of The Traitors won outstanding reality competition programme.\n\nIts host Alan Cumming paid tribute to the show's \"crew in Scotland who had to understand the concept that the Scottish summer is sometimes oxymoronic\".\n\nHe added: \"It's a difficult time that we live in but it's so great that our show brings a little bit of joy into this life.\"\n\nOther winners included Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which took home two prizes including best scripted variety series; Star Wars spin-off Andor, which won best drama writing; and Slow Horses, which won a directing prize.\n\nThe Emmys ceremony unusually ran broadly on schedule, ending only a few minutes late.\n\nThat was party due to a clever policy employed by host Nate Bargatze, who started the night by saying a $100,000 donation he was making to charity would be reduced for every speech that went over the time limit, while every short speech would add more money to the fund.\n\nBut despite the amount of money going up and down throughout the night, the ceremony ended with him and broadcast network CBS announcing they would, in fact, donate $250,000 in total to US charity The Boys & Girls Clubs of America.\n\nBBC News used AI to help write the summary at the top of this article.

So what was it like to be part of a cultural phenomenon?\n\n\"It was so exciting because it's so highly anticipated and everybody wants to know what's going to happen,\" London-born Brown, 26, says.\n\n\"The fan base are so passionate, which is something you don't always get.\"\n\nShe says she \"didn't really realise\" how big the fandom of the show was until its release.\n\n\"So I think that was a good thing, to be fair, because otherwise, from the beginning, I would have been like: 'Oh my God'.\"\n\nAs the show's Paris-era was unlocked, viewers have been introduced to a new supporting cast in Belly's circle in the French capital, including Gemma, who like Belly, is new to Paris.\n\nBrown describes her character as a \"kindred spirit\" to Belly.\n\nThey meet outside a nightclub, when Gemma is being bothered by a man. Belly steps in to help her out and the two become friends.\n\nBrown says it is one of her favourite moments and shows \"women supporting each other\".\n\nAccording to Amazon, this season's first episode drew in 25 million global viewers, a 40% increase on the previous season, with Prime Video saying it is its most-watched TV season among women aged 18-34.\n\nBrown thinks the success of the show comes down to the writing by Jenny Han, who wrote the young adult (YA) romance books the TV series is based on.\n\n\"She knows what she's doing. She's got everybody hooked from the books,\" Brown says.\n\n\"It's lucky me to be a little part of that.\"\n\nBrown feels another reason why the show resonates is \"because we all go through it\".\n\n\"We go through friendship, heartache, love, confusion. For the audience that watch this show and love The Summer I Turned Pretty that is a big thing, it's a new thing, it forms so much of your life.\n\n\"Being able to watch someone's else experience of that is helpful... and we all love a bit of romance,\" she says.\n\nBeyond the traditional audience watching on screens, there are countless fan edits and reaction videos posted on social media, which Corinna says have been positive towards her character.\n\n\"They've been lovely. I've only seen good things. They say they like Gemma giving her [Belly] straight advice.\"\n\nAlready beloved by YA fans for her turn as Tara Jones in Netflix-hit Heartstopper, Brown is no stranger to the world of teen romance adaptations.\n\n\"With any show that's for a young audience, you have to have that awareness of the young minds that you're inspiring, shaping,\" Brown says.\n\n\"And that's an honour in itself.\"\n\nAmid all the buzz of the show, secrets are tightly guarded and with the finale about to drop we are not allowed to ask Brown what happens in it.\n\nBut we can't help but ask what feels to fans like the summer's most pressing question: Are you team Conrad or team Jeremiah?\n\n\"I'm going to keep my lips tight on that one,\" Brown says, smiling.\n\n\"But what I will say is I am Team Gemma and Team Belly's friendship forever.\""}

They get in quite a good shape and the distances between their lines are much smaller, which makes them harder to play through.\n\nUnfortunately for Amorim, the improvements they have made there have been overlooked because of the silly mistakes they are making in conceding goals which are costing them points.\n\nWhen I look at some of the goals they have conceded this season, including Phil Foden's opener for City at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, they are down to selection issues, and players being used in the wrong position, rather than the system itself.\n\nManchester United's Derby Woes & Remembering Ricky Hatton\n\nHaaland scores twice as Man City cruise to win against Man Utd\n\nIn the first half against City, United did well. They won the ball back four or five times high up the pitch and, with a bit more finesse in those counter-attacks, they could have scored themselves.\n\nOne of the problems with Amorim's 3-4-2-1 is the two holding midfielders can be outnumbered but that did not happen at Etihad Stadium because Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, who were playing either side of Benjamin Sesko, dropped in.\n\nThe team narrowed up which helped Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, because there were no big gaps.\n\nMost of the time the defence and the midfield were close to each other too, rather than the defence dropping off like they did last season because of a lack of pace or confidence.\n\nCity did not completely play through them and tear them apart, and that's not how they scored their first goal either.\n\nWhat happened there is that you have got Fernandes, arguably one of the best number 10s in the world, playing in a deeper centre-midfield role as a number eight when his instincts are not defensive.\n\nA simple run off the back from Foden was all it took to lose him.\n\nBruno Fernandes was watching Jeremy Doku, not Phil Foden when the Belgian winger reached the byeline\n\nYes, you could argue Luke Shaw might have done better when the ball was in the box but Foden is free by that point, because Fernandes switched off.\n\nAs I highlighted on Match of the Day, he is ball-watching when the cross comes over. I don't think he is lazy, because he is back in position.\n\nHe is just not used to spotting runners and seeing danger.\n\nDoku put over a cross and found the unmarked Foden who was bursting into the box\n\nThat's the second time he has cost United a goal this season, because he also failed to track Emile Smith Rowe for Fulham's equaliser when they dropped points at Craven Cottage in August.\n\nThe irony with Fernandes against City was that certain aspects of his play in the middle of the pitch were extremely good.\n\nIt's not a totally stupid idea to play him there, because his passing from deep is tremendous to find the runners ahead of him, and he is technically excellent as well as being brave on the ball.\n\nThe problem is what happens without it. A player of his intelligence should be able to learn to switch on a bit more in defensive situations too, but it's clearly not happening.\n\nYou just can't play in that role if that's a regular occurrence for you, and it is down to the manager to recognise that and put players in there who do it better.\n\nMan Utd a team with round pegs in square holes - analysis\n\nFernandes is not the only United player I look at and think he is a square peg in a round hole.\n\nShaw has played in a back three before but he has spent the majority of his career as a dynamic left-back and it feels like he is being shoe-horned into a centre-back position under Amorim.\n\nAgain you can argue he should have the quality to adapt, and for Jeremy Doku to beat him so easily for the first goal was poor defending whether you are a left-back or a centre-half, but if any players are not completely comfortable in their roles, then it is going to affect the team.\n\nFor City's second goal, again it was not down to the United system failing, more a mixture of things - and a multitude of individual mistakes.\n\nUgarte starts off on Foden but then follows the ball, like he did in the City move that led to their opener, and goes to press Nico O'Reilly, leaving Foden free.\n\nFrom there it's a knock-on effect.\n\nNoussair Mazraoui comes out to Foden but can't stop him playing a pass around the corner, Leny Yoro gets rolled by Doku - the one player you know you don't get tight to - then Shaw is not strong or fast enough to stop Erling Haaland.\n\nUltimately, most goals are down to a mistake somewhere but when players are comfortable in the system, and in the right position within it, they do the right things - and the errors don't stack up like that.\n\nWe have to remember that United's start to the season has not been horrendous - they should have beaten Arsenal, they did beat Burnley and will feel they had enough chances in the first half against Fulham to get the job done there too.\n\nBut they got found out against City, and as the second half wore on they could have shipped even more goals.\n\nWe know by now Amorim won't change his formation but he is bringing a lot of his problems on himself by picking the wrong players in the wrong position within it.\n\nI still think Fernandes as a number 10, with two holding midfielders behind him, is one of the best in the world but it seems unlikely he will get the chance to show it at United.\n\nIf United continue to play the same personnel in the same system - including Fernandes in central midfield, a role he has not played often enough to understand - then the same things we are seeing are probably going to keep happening.\n\nIt's very rare that players change their thinking on the pitch that much and while they don't have that balance, they are going to keep getting caught out.\n\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\n'We suffer goals we can avoid' - Amorim frustrated with United loss"}

The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests.\n\nOur BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker.\n\nYoung Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels.\n\nAt least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network.\n\nMr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.\n\nWe have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.\n\nMr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.\n\nOne of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda.\n\nShe found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022.\n\n\"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us.\n\nMonic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita.\n\n\"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled.\n\n\"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia.\n\n\"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\"\n\nMonic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her.\n\nMia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes.\n\n\"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly.\n\nAnother woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent.\n\n\"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces.\n\nHer experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish.\n\n\"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\"\n\nLexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\"\n\nWe put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply.\n\nLexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.\n\nFinding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media.\n\nBut through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle.\n\nTo corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties.\n\nMr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business.\n\n\"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\"\n\nHe explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\".\n\nWhen asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have.\"\n\nIn the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006.\n\nHe went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business.\n\n\"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me.\"\n\nTroy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run.\n\nHe says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients.\n\n\"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\"\n\nMr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork.\n\nOn 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months.\n\nAccording to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network.\n\n\"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says.\n\nMonic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022.\n\nMonic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers.\n\nPolice told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says.\n\nHe obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her.\n\nBut a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss.\n\nMichael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed.\n\nHe says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients.\n\nHe claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy.\n\n\"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael.\n\nMia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it.\n\nMonic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa.\n\nThe phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation.\n\nKayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death.\n\nWhile Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned.\n\nOur investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies.\n\nMonic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf.\n\nAs Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year.\n\nBut these opportunities can carry a risk.\n\nMariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf.\n\n\"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us.\n\nFor Monic's family, grief is now tangled with fear. Fear for other families who could suffer the same loss they have, if nothing is done.\n\n\"We are all looking at Monica's death,\" her relative Michael told us. \"But who is there for the girls still alive? They're still there. Still suffering.\"\n\nThe BBC asked Charles \"Abbey\" Mwesigwa to respond to all the allegations made in our investigation. He denied running an illegal prostitution ring.\n\nHe said: \"These are all false allegations.\n\n\"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it.\"\n\nHe also said: \"[Monic] died with her passport meaning no-one was demanding her money for taking her. Prior to her death, I hadn't seen her for over four to five weeks.\n\n\"I knew [Monic and Kayla] and [they] were renting with different landlords. If no-one in both flats was arrested or any of the landlords, then there was a reason. Both incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and maybe they can help you.\"\n\nThe BBC contacted Al Barsha Police Station to request to see the case files for Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi. It did not respond to that request or to allegations Monica and Kayla's deaths had not been properly investigated.\n\nThe BBC was unable to see any toxicology reports in relation to Monic Karungi, or speak to the landlord of the apartment in which she was living when she died."}

Its creation reflected the shared desire of Arab countries emerging from colonial rule to coordinate their political stances, promote regional solidarity and safeguard their sovereignty and independence.\n\nOver the decades, membership grew to 22 states, stretching from North Africa to the Gulf. Egypt was suspended in 1979 after signing a peace treaty with Israel, but its membership was reinstated in 1989. Libya was suspended during the 2011 uprising but readmitted later that year. Syria was suspended in 2011 amid its civil war and reinstated in 2023.\n\nThe group accounts for about 3.25 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), with several members ranked among the world’s leading oil producers.\n\nCountries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Libya, and Algeria are also part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and hold some of the largest proven oil reserves. Collectively, Arab League members produce about a quarter of the world’s oil.\n\nAll Arab League members are also part of the 57-member OIC.\n\nThe OIC, which was formed in 1969 in response to an arson attack on Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque, brings together 57 countries with significant Muslim populations across Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas.\n\nIn September 1969, Muslim leaders met in Rabat, Morocco, to establish a body that would safeguard Islamic holy sites, protect shared political and economic interests, and promote solidarity among Muslim-majority nations on the global stage.\n\nOver time, its membership expanded from 30 to 57 states, reflecting its growing reach. Today, the OIC represents more than 2.1 billion people — about 26 percent of the world’s population and 8 percent of the world’s GDP.\n\nIn its early years, the OIC had loose membership rules. Its original charter allowed any Muslim state to join with the approval of two-thirds of existing members, which opened the door for countries without Muslim majorities but with significant Muslim populations. These include Gabon, the Maldives, Mauritania, Uganda, Mozambique, Cameroon, Togo, Benin, the Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau.\n\nIn the Americas, Guyana and Suriname joined despite having relatively small Muslim communities.\n\nThe 2008 charter revision made membership stricter. Now, a country must be a United Nations member (with Palestine as the exception), have a Muslim-majority population, abide by the charter and apply formally. Even then, admission requires consensus among all 57 members — a difficult task.\n\nAlbania is the only European state in the OIC.\n\nThe organisation has maintained a consistent and forceful stance against Israeli actions, particularly regarding occupation and military offensives in Palestine.\n\nOver the past three years, the OIC has convened several emergency summits and ministerial meetings — most notably in Riyadh, Jeddah and Istanbul – to condemn Israeli attacks on Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and, more recently, strikes involving Iran and Qatar.\n\nThe group has repeatedly called for immediate ceasefires, protection of Palestinian civilians and international accountability for what it describes as “Israeli crimes”."}

The move is seen as a way to try to expedite a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nTrump’s request to Brussels, first reported by the Financial Times newspaper, follows remarks from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said that Washington was preparing tighter economic restrictions on Russia but needed stronger European backing.\n\nIn a letter posted on his Truth Social account on September 13, Trump said he was “ready to do major sanctions on Russia” once NATO had “agreed … to do the same thing”. He also claimed that elevated tariffs on China would weaken Beijing’s “control” over Russia.\n\nChina and India buy Russia’s oil, which is helping to keep the Russian economy afloat.\n\nAs the largest buyer of Russian energy, China imported 109 million tonnes of crude oil last year, representing nearly 20 percent of its total energy imports, according to Chinese customs data. India, by contrast, imported 88 million tonnes of Russian oil in 2024, or 15 percent of its imports.\n\nAnd while Trump recently slapped an extra 25 percent tariff on India for importing Russian crude, he has so far refrained from imposing similar tariffs on China as his administration navigates a delicate trade truce with Beijing.\n\nTo sidestep the issue, Trump on Saturday asked NATO to impose 50-100 percent tariffs on China to weaken Beijing’s economic grip over Russia.\n\nIn the letter Trump posted on Saturday, he claimed the halt on Russian energy purchases, combined with heavy tariffs on China, would be of “great help” in ending the conflict.\n\nEurope’s reliance on Russian energy has fallen since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the time, the EU imported 45 percent of its natural gas from Russia. That is expected to fall to just 13 percent this year. But Trump wants Europe to do more.\n\nThe US president’s requests come amid heightened tensions between NATO and Russia. More than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace last Wednesday, and one entered Romanian airspace on Saturday. Poland and Romania are both members of NATO.\n\nWarsaw said the drone incursion was deliberate, but Moscow downplayed the incident and said it had “no plans to target” Poland. Bucharest, meanwhile, scrambled fighter jets to intercept the Russian drone on Saturday evening and has denounced Moscow’s “irresponsible actions”.\n\nFrance and Germany have notably joined a new NATO mission to bolster the group’s eastern flank and will move some military assets eastwards.\n\nIn a Fox News interview last Friday, Trump said his patience with Putin was beginning to run out following recent face-to-face talks in Alaska and amid Russia’s increasing aerial attacks on Ukraine, including its largest-ever air attack earlier this month.\n\nThe US president expressed frustration with Putin’s failure to halt the war and said he is considering additional sanctions on Russian banks and energy products.\n\n“We’re going to have to come down very, very strong,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s push for allied tariffs against China and Russia comes at a time when his own legal authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is being challenged at home. In May, a US trade court ruled that the tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the president”. An appeals court upheld that ruling in August, and the case is now headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nA decision over the legality of Trump’s tariffs is expected in November.\n\nThe bilateral trade in goods between Brussels and Beijing reached approximately 732 billion euros ($860bn) in 2024. The EU ran a trade deficit in goods with China of around 305.8 billion euros ($359bn) last year, up from about 297 billion euros ($349bn) in 2023, making China the EU’s largest import partner.\n\nFor context, the US remains Europe’s largest trading partner. In 2024, the total trade in goods and services between the EU and the US amounted to 1.68 trillion euros ($1.98 trillion). Here, the EU had a goods trade surplus of 198 billion euros ($233bn), and an overall surplus of 50 billion euros ($59bn).\n\nThe bulk of Europe’s imports from China – roughly 40 percent – come in the form of consumer electronics, followed by heavy manufacturing equipment and then clothing and accessories.\n\nEuropean goods imports from India, comparatively, are small. In 2024, the EU ran a goods trade deficit – mostly in the form of electronic equipment, pharmaceuticals and base metals like iron and steel – of just 22.5 billion euros ($26bn) with India.\n\nThe upshot is that Europe is highly dependent on goods imported from China — and much less so on India. Chinese manufacturing imports are deeply integrated into European supply chains.\n\nSuddenly imposing tariffs, particularly at levels of 50-100 percent, would disrupt manufacturing, increase production costs and raise consumer prices across the EU, which is why the bloc will likely be wary of adopting unilateral punitive tariffs.\n\nStill, some EU member states have publicly backed targeted measures against China. On September 12, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) bloc of nations – which includes France, Germany and Italy – convened a call to discuss additional sanctions on Russia and possible tariffs on countries they see as “enabling” the war in Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, Turkiye, which is a NATO member, is the third-largest buyer of Russia’s oil products, after China and India. Other NATO members that purchase Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nWithin hours of Trump’s September 13 pronouncement to NATO members, Beijing responded by saying that China does not participate in wars or help to plot them.\n\nWang Yi, China’s foreign minister, said that war cannot solve problems and sanctions only complicate them, according to a statement from China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Bessent will meet with China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng in Madrid on Monday to try to de-escalate trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nAs for US-India relations, Trump said on September 9 that the two countries were “continuing negotiations to address the trade barriers” between them.\n\nHe plans to speak to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming weeks and expects a “successful conclusion” to their trade talks, he wrote on social media.\n\nIn response, Modi echoed Trump’s optimism that the talks would be successful and said the two countries were “close friends and natural partners”.\n\n“Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest,” Modi said. “I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump.”"}

Famine has been declared,” wrote the experts, in reference to the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report last month that officially declared famine in parts of Gaza.\n\nThey pointed out that there is a liquidity crisis in Gaza as most banks and ATMs have been destroyed, Israel has blocked the inflow of new currency, and wages are paling in comparison to stratospheric inflation caused by a total siege.\n\nAfter the war, cooking oil prices rose by 1,200 percent and flour by 5,000 percent by mid-2025, they said, adding that humanitarian workers are reportedly losing nearly 40 percent of their salaries just to access their wages, and digital payments are impeded by electricity and telecommunications outages.\n\nThe four experts noted that the occupied West Bank is also under increasing financial strain as Israel has arbitrarily diverted or withheld tax revenues owed to the Palestinian Authority in violation of the Oslo Accords.\n\nIsrael’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wants to cancel annual waivers that allow Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks, something the experts said “would cut Palestinians off from the global financial system”.\n\nMeanwhile, work permits have been suspended for 100,000 Palestinian workers, slashing cash inflows that previously represented a quarter of all gross national income.\n\n“These measures exacerbate heavy economic losses from the illegal taking of land and the illegal exploitation of natural resources by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank,” the experts said.\n\nThey emphasised that Israel is violating its human rights obligations and its legal requirements as an occupying power, and is impeding the collective rights of the Palestinian people to economic self-determination and control over natural wealth and resources.\n\nIn July, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory released a report mapping the corporations aiding Israel in the displacement of Palestinians and its genocidal war on Gaza, in breach of international law.\n\nFrancesca Albanese’s report named 48 corporate actors, including United States tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet Inc, which is Google’s parent company. A database of more than 1,000 corporate entities was also put together as part of the investigation."}

And that’s because it stands to lose too much money.\n\nBy Mohammad Aaquib\n\nKolkata-based writer and researcher.\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nIndia’s most recent encounter with Pakistan in the Asia Cup was celebrated as a patriotic spectacle: a win dedicated to the armed forces and those affected by the Pahalgam attack. Such declarations, however, expose something deeper: a strategy of playing politics with sport, hypocrisy masked as principle.\n\nBeneath this posturing and tokenism lies a contradiction too stark to ignore. This is not just sport. It is cynical theatre in which administrators, players and commentators attempt to ride on two boats at the same time. The hypocrisy is visible to anyone with a sane set of eyes.\n\nAt the heart of this contradiction is the relationship between India and Pakistan in cricket. Officially, India refuses bilateral cricket with Pakistan. The line is firm: no tours, no series and no diplomacy. The justification rests on national security, especially after the clash between the South Asian neighbours in May.\n\nIndian artists are banned from collaborating with their Pakistani counterparts. Pakistani singers and actors once popular in India have been cut off on social media and otherwise. Indian celebrities themselves are trolled and shamed for past collaborations done on neutral grounds.\n\nYet the same ecosystem explodes with excitement when India faces Pakistan in multination tournaments. Matches are packaged as spectacles, marketed as the “greatest rivalry” and cashed in for billions in advertising revenue.\n\nThis duality is not accidental. Jay Shah, now serving in International Cricket Council (ICC) leadership, has been accused of pressuring Team India into playing Pakistan despite reluctance from within the camp. Sanjay Raut, a member of parliament in India, recently alleged that Shah’s hand forced the decision, turning the match into an obligation rather than a choice.\n\nIf true, this signals how far politics has penetrated Indian cricket administration for the sake of money and clout. The game is no longer simply sport but a vehicle for symbolic battles decided in boardrooms, not dressing rooms.\n\nThe hypocrisy becomes sharper when one considers the home environment. While Indians in other spheres faced online lynching for working with Pakistani colleagues even before the war, cricketers are being placed on a pedestal for defeating Pakistan. It is not only about double standards. It is about a calculated exploitation of sentiment.\n\nCricket is permitted as the only arena of “contact” because cricket sells more than most things in India. The ban on cultural exchange is explained as nationalism, but cricket is exempted in the name of multilateral obligations and commercial survival. Dedications of wins to soldiers and terror victims act as moral cover for what is essentially a business transaction. This is sheer hypocrisy and tokenism.\n\nIf India insists on involving politics in sport, consistency demands more. Look at Muslim athletes and countries known for boycotting matches against Israeli opponents. They forfeit games, risk sanctions and face bans. Whatever one thinks of their politics, their actions are clear, uncompromised and costly. They make a stand and face consequences.\n\nIndia refuses bilateral cricket with Pakistan yet plays them in ICC tournaments because the money is too big to lose, especially when most of it comes home through viewership endorsements and advertisements. It tries to sail on two boats, waving nationalism with one hand while collecting profits with the other. The dedication of victories to the armed forces does not erase that contradiction. It exposes it.\n\nThe India-Pakistan rivalry itself is not what it used to be. Competitive balance has tilted drastically. India has dominated recent contests due to the Pakistani team’s poor form. Suspense is long gone, but the manufactured hype remains.\n\nBroadcasters and advertisers pump the match as if it still defines the fate of nations. In reality, it defines the fate of sponsorship deals. The sporting value is hollowed out. The symbolic gestures after each victory only add to the theatre. In their latest match on Sunday, Indian players refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts.\n\nSuch dissonance turns patriotism into branding and erodes the dignity of national discourse. The Board of Control for Cricket in India, the ICC leadership and political voices close to the game must confront this contradiction. Cricket cannot remain both business and battlefield. A rivalry stripped of sporting essence but inflated with symbolism cannot endure. The Pahalgam victims deserve solidarity but should not be used as props for cricketing theatre. Sport deserves freedom from tokenism.\n\nInstead of continuing this hybrid model of opportunism, India can opt for one of two choices. It can refuse to play Pakistan entirely, across all formats, including ICC tournaments. That would align deeds with words at the highest level. It would be costly in terms of ICC sanctions and revenues, but it would at least be consistent.\n\nOr India can accept playing Pakistan as part of sport while removing politics and symbolic dedications from the game. That would mean treating cricket as cricket, not as a stage for nationalism.\n\nIndia’s cricket establishment must choose one path. If it wants politics in sport, it must show the courage of consistency. If it wants to keep politics out, it must strip away the hollow dedications and patriotic posturing.

Indigenous peoples, farmers, fisherfolk and people in wheelchairs carrying fairly innocuous signs that read, “Save the Earth! Save generations!” were pushed back by the police and prevented from reaching the State Palace, a frequent demonstration site.\n\nEven though climate advocates formally notified authorities of the march, held to urge the passage of a Climate Justice Bill, demonstrators still got a small taste of aggressive police tactics. These police tactics turned deadly later in the week in fiery youth-led protests against lawmaker perks, in which at least 10 people were killed and thousands detained.\n\nThere’s no sugarcoating what many Indonesians feel about the recent violence: anger but also dread and fear. We are a nation of survivors, having faced the brutality of a military dictatorship that lasted three decades and killed an estimated 500,000 to one million civilians. Our collective skins bear the scars of authoritarian rule, which still tingle. But we’ve also never allowed guns and tear gas to silence us – which is why civil society has pushed initial demands to scrap lawmaker perks even further.\n\nNow, people no longer want just piecemeal responses that try to put the lid on boiling rage. They want thorough reforms that would address the sources of pent-up anger: low wages and rising costs of living while oligarchs and big corporations bleed the people dry. This is scarcely a new narrative. But as the fiery protests show, people have to draw the line at some point.\n\nThe climate movement, too, is drawing the line. We too are tired of being ignored while the planet keeps heating up, our rainforests are being cut down, “green” mining is driving Indigenous peoples from their land, and coal plants keep running despite repeated pledges by our leaders to phase them out.\n\nIndonesia is among the world’s top 10 emitters. It is also home to some of the world’s largest – and last remaining – carbon sinks. Both reducing emissions and protecting natural resources are crucial to keeping the planet cool and protecting the people from even more devastating climate impacts.\n\nBut instead of using these resources wisely for wealth redistribution and sustainable national development, our leaders have repeatedly been accessories to corruption and environmental plunder that benefit cronies and big corporations at the expense of the people and the planet.\n\nNext week, President Prabowo Subianto is expected to appear at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. It is the first time in a decade that an Indonesian leader will attend the forum. It is clear that the president wants to make his mark as a global leader of significance. But his ambitions can’t shine in the dark. To earn credibility and prove that his military past does not define his current leadership, he must first ensure that human rights are respected at home.\n\nPrabowo has made exceptionally strong statements on climate commitments. At the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro last year, he announced plans for the early retirement of all coal-fired power plants within 15 years. Even more dramatically, he said in July that Indonesia could achieve 100 percent renewable energy within the next 10 years.\n\nBut more than statements, we need action embodied in concrete plans and ambitious emissions reduction goals. Indonesia’s latest climate pledge, the Second Nationally Determined Contribution, which the government aims to submit before Prabowo’s UN speech, will be a litmus test – just like how he responds to demands for justice and reform.\n\nMeanwhile, as inequality deepens, the climate crisis rages on. Extreme floods, longer droughts and more intense heatwaves may hit us all, but their impacts are not equal. The poor and the working class are the ones suffering the most as they lose their livelihoods, their homes and, now, even their most basic human rights. And unless we act with urgency and courage, our children will inherit a planet where survival itself becomes a privilege, not a right.\n\nThere can be no climate justice without human rights. Whenever there’s injustice, we must put up a good fight – whether it concerns the climate or social injustice.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."}

But Robinson’s family is staunchly Republican.\n\nBy Sarah Shamim\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nConservative activist and social media personality Charlie Kirk was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University in the United States on Wednesday.\n\nAfter more than a two-day manhunt, authorities arrested and named 22-year-old Utah resident Tyler Robinson as the suspect in Kirk’s shooting.\n\nWhile naming Robinson, authorities said a motive was unknown. Since then, however, politicians and posts on social media platforms have speculated about what might have driven Robinson to allegedly shoot Kirk.\n\nHere is what we know so far about Robinson and potential motives:\n\nOn Friday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox named Robinson as the person suspected of fatally shooting Kirk.\n\nRobinson is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in St George, Utah.\n\nState records from Utah showed that Robinson is a registered voter in the state, but he is not affiliated with any political party. He did not vote in the two most recent general elections when he was of voting age.\n\nAt the beginning of the hunt for Kirk’s shooter, Utah’s Department of Public Safety released grainy surveillance camera photos of a white man wearing Converse trainers, jeans, a long-sleeved black T-shirt with a US flag and eagle on it, and a black baseball cap with a triangle.\n\nRobinson’s listed address is his parents’ home near St George, about a 3.5-hour drive from Utah Valley University. Robinson’s parents are both registered Republicans.\n\nOther family members have spoken in news interviews about how the extended family too is Republican. On social media platforms, some of Robinson’s photos show him holding guns.\n\nBut in an affidavit filed by prosecutors against Robinson after his arrest, they said a family member had told them that he had “become more political in recent years”.\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent Robert Bohls described Robinson’s weapon as “a high-powered, bolt-action rifle”.\n\nAccording to the affidavit filed by prosecutors against Robinson on Friday, investigators found a .30-06-calibre, bolt-action Mauser Model 98 rifle wrapped in a dark coloured towel allegedly discarded by Robinson.\n\nWhile prosecutors have not spelled out a motive for Robinson’s alleged act, their affidavit details conversations with the family member who referred to the suspect’s increasingly political turn and to Robinson’s flatmate.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, one of Kirk’s family members told investigators that Robinson had visited for a family dinner before the shooting. While talking to another family member, Robinson had talked about his dislike for Kirk.\n\nThe other family member also echoed Robinson’s dislike, and both individuals said they did not like Kirk’s viewpoints. The family member also said Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.\n\nCox, a Republican, told The Wall Street Journal that Robinson was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology“.\n\nCox referenced cryptic messages that prosecutors said were engraved on shell casings recovered with the rifle allegedly used in Kirk’s shooting.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, one fired casing read: “Notices, bulges OWO what’s this?”\n\nThree unfired shell casings also had messages. They read: “hey fascist! CATCH!” with an up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols; a reference to an antifascist Italian folk song, “O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!”; and “If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.”\n\nCox also referenced the sexual identity of Robinson’s flatmate and partner, who the governor said had been cooperating with investigators.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Cox said Robinson’s roommate was transgender, “a male transitioning to female”, who was romantically involved with Robinson.\n\nThe Utah governor said that unlike the suspect’s family and flatmate, Robinson himself was “not cooperating” with the investigation.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Robinson’s roommate revealed electronic messages that Robinson sent that could provide more clues about the suspected shooter’s motive.\n\nIn the messages, the sender, named “Tyler”, said he had left a rifle in a bush and had to retrieve it. “Tyler” also wrote that he wrapped the rifle in a towel. The messages also talk about engraving bullets."}

Erdogan has described the CHP network as corrupt, comparing it with “an octopus whose arms stretch to other parts of Turkiye and abroad”.\n\nReporting from Ankara, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said the CHP congress case had been criticised by legal experts.\n\n“Many legal experts are against the procedure because, according to the Turkish laws, any irregularity related to a political party’s internal dynamics should be taken care of by the higher election board, not by a local board,” Koseoglu noted.\n\nImamoglu, the CHP’s presidential candidate, also accused Erdogan and his allies of anti-democratic actions.\n\n“This isn’t about the CHP, it’s about the existence or absence of democracy in Turkiye,” he said, after appearing in court on Friday in an unrelated case.\n\nThe CHP has had a chequered history with democracy despite founding modern Turkiye. The CHP pursued authoritarian policies in the past that suppressed ethnic and religious minorities and it has been a key factor in how Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) were able to rise to power and hold it.\n\nThere is also an historical distrust of the CHP from many communities who will continue to stand with the AKP regardless.\n\nAfter Imamoglu’s arrest, Turkiye experienced its largest protests in more than a decade.\n\nIn advance of the Ankara court ruling, at least 50,000 people took part in a protest in the capital on Sunday.\n\nOver the weekend, the Turkish authorities arrested 48 more people as part of the inquiry into the CHP.\n\nOn September 2, a court removed the leadership of the party’s Istanbul branch over the allegations of vote-buying at its provincial congress. The decision was seen by analysts as a test run for the congress case that was adjourned on Monday.\n\nFollowing the ruling earlier this month, Turkiye’s stock market plummeted by 5.5 percent, raising fears about its already fragile economy."}

He again said Israel will hit Hamas “wherever they are”.\n\nRubio leaned heavily into the Israeli narrative on the war, saying, “Hamas needs to cease to exist as an armed element that can threaten peace and security in the region.”\n\nThe top US diplomat said “we are focused on what happens next” when asked about Israel’s strike in Doha.\n\nThe show of unity comes a day after Rubio and Netanyahu visited the Western Wall along with US envoy Mike Huckabee and praised strong bilateral relations.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said: “The main takeaway from the press conference here was that no new information was presented to the public regarding the attack on Gaza, regarding Israeli military expansion and regarding Israel’s attack that has now been widely condemned and criticised internationally in the Qatari capital, Doha.”\n\n“Netanyahu didn’t exactly say he would rule it out in the future, but he didn’t confirm or deny the results of that attack. Rubio was shying away from condemning it. He said they’re just trying to find a path forward, they don’t want to focus on the past but focus on the future,” she added.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council announced on Monday that it would host an urgent debate on Tuesday regarding Israel’s “recent military aggression” in Qatar.\n\nThe council said it received two official requests for the debate – one from Pakistan on behalf of member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the other from Kuwait on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).\n\nThe meeting will mark the council’s 10th urgent debate since its creation in 2006.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly dismissed the findings and resolutions of the council on Israeli abuses, including one that urged all states last year to cease selling or transferring arms to Israel, given the carnage in Gaza. Israel and the US boycotted the UN council earlier this year.\n\nIn Gaza on Monday, four fetuses and three premature babies died in Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis due to the Israeli siege and man-made starvation.\n\nAccording to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, at least 422 people, including 145 children, have died due to the ongoing hunger crisis. Since the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report last month that officially declared famine in parts of Gaza, at least 144 deaths have been recorded, including 30 children.\n\nIsraeli bombs continue to rain down on Gaza City in the north, including its residential buildings, with dozens more Palestinians killed on Monday as Israel carries on with the systematic destruction of the area.\n\nلحظة قصف الاحتلال بصاروخين لبرج الغفري السكني في مدينة غزة، ما تسبب بتدميره بالكامل. pic.twitter.com/tvkIPmrc9v\n\n— شبكة قدس الإخبارية (@qudsn) September 15, 2025\n\n[Translation: The moment the occupation bombed the al-Ghafri residential tower in Gaza City with two missiles, causing its complete destruction.]\n\nIsrael’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on Monday he wants to build a luxurious seashore neighbourhood with high-rise buildings for Israeli police officers over the ruins of Gaza.\n\n“We will finish the mission, occupy Gaza, encourage voluntary emigration,” he said, according to Israeli media outlets.\n\nThe families of Israeli captives held in Gaza on Monday requested an urgent meeting with the army chief, Eyal Zamir, after he said Netanyahu has kept the military in the dark about the next steps after seizing Gaza City, and that occupying the area would not lead to the political and military surrender of Hamas.\n\nAmid Israel’s advancing plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, the United Kingdom-founded Oxfam International was among 80 civil society organisations that launched a new “Stop Trade With Settlements” campaign on Monday, demanding that countries ban all trade with illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, including by major multinational companies like Maersk, Siemens, and Barclays.\n\nThe organisations said in a statement that their campaign targets settlement trade specifically “because of Israel’s ongoing and escalating oppression of Palestinians in the West Bank [including East Jerusalem], fragmentation of its economy, and undermining of the viability of a future Palestinian state“.\n\nDuring his visit to Israel, Rubio is expected to attend the inauguration of a controversial tunnel project for religious tourists that goes underneath the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan to the holy sites.\n\nThe project has stirred fears among Palestinian residents that it could further dilute their presence and possibly put at risk the physical foundations of their homes.\n\nFakhri Abu Diab, 63, a community spokesman in Silwan, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency that Rubio should instead visit homes, such as his, that have been demolished by Israel in what Palestinians see as a targeted campaign to erase them.\n\n“Instead of siding with international law, the US is going the way of extremists and the far right and ignoring our history,” he said.\n\nRubio played down the political implications, calling it “one of the most important archaeological sites in the world”."}
